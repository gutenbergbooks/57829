      <div class='line'><i>My Lord</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>I count it no small Happiness, in an
Age so Censorious as this, to have
found a Patron so universally admir’d,
that I am under no apprehension
of being thought a Flatterer,
should I make use of and indulge all the
Liberty of a profest Panegyrist; but
that is what a sense of my own Inability
and Your Lordship’s Modesty forbids:
It is sufficient for me, that, under Your
Lordship’s known Learning in Antiquity
and History, both Antient and Modern,
my weak Endeavours at restoring
a <i>lost Science</i> may be secure from the
Assaults of the <i>Envious</i> or the <i>Ignorant</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have nothing to fear from the Animosities
of Parties, since how inveterate
soever they may be against each other,
yet they all agree in this one Point, to
Esteem and Honour Your Lordship, who
are the <i>Atticus</i> of the Times, by Your
Virtues endear’d to all sides, and each
believing that not to Value Your Lordship,
would be to discover such an
aversion to Honour and Virtue as the
worst of Men would abhor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Your Virtues, my Lord, are so conspicuous,
that they give you that Natural
and Rational Right to true Nobility,
which the <i>Roman</i> Satyrist so justly
exprest:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nobilitas sola est atq; unica Virtus.</span></i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I will not dispute whether or no there be
any Intrinsic Value in a long Descent,
or whether that be deriv’d from the necessity
of a Subordination essential to
Government, or else from the just Reward
of Virtue, which ennobles all the
Posterity of the Possessors of it, it being
here a very useless Disquisition since
Your Lordship’s Family is of so very
high an Original that none can boast a
greater Antiquity, and that Your Lordship
is possest of all that Merit which first
distinguish’d Man from Man, and gave a
Preeminence to the Deserving. Among
all the Excellencies which thus dignifie
Your Lordship’s Character, perhaps there
is none more eminent than Your Protection
and Encouragement of Arts and
Sciences, to which the <i>English</i> World owe
the incomparable Mr. <i>Lock</i>’s <cite>Essays on Human
Understanding</cite>, and other Works extreamly
beneficial to the Public. Neither
do I in the least question but Your
Lordship’s Protection of so excellent and
useful an <i>Art</i> as <i>Surgery</i>, will render it as
flourishing here in <i>England</i> as it is in any
other part of the World. ’Tis true we
are not wanting of some extraordinary
Professors of that <i>Art</i>, but I could also
heartily wish we had not a greater number
of Bad, and yet perhaps the chief
occasion of this may be the want of a due
Method of Encouragement, by which
the modest Endeavours of young Proficients
are eclips’d, and which (to make
a Comparison) like tender Plants, are
nipp’d in the Bud and perish for want
of Watering.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now as the want of Opportunity has
been in some respect a prejudice to my
Business, so also the want of Encouragement
has in a great measure been a hindrance
to this Work: For what regret of
Mind must it needs occasion, to find
none esteem’d but such as speak Experience
in their Looks, and that Youth
should be despis’d tho’ never so hopeful
and industrious, meerly because of a particular
number of Years, and what an
interruption must it be to our painful
Studies, to think that even the best Performances
of this kind are contemn’d
because they are chiefly a Collection,
when on the contrary it is receiv’d as an
establish’d Maxim, that such as Travel
into Foreign Countries, are not only the
most capable to describe them, but also
whatsoever they relate is look’d upon as
the sole matter of Fact and Truth, when
many times Business is better transacted
by Correspondence, and those that have
been at the trouble, expence and danger
of Travelling have come home no more
improv’d than they went out, except in
the Fashions and Levities of the Age, yet
are we commonly so imprudent as to value
Things meerly for their coming from a
far and at a great deal of Expence; but
whilst we admire those Novelties, we are
often misled and deceiv’d by meer Fables
and imaginary Stories of such Things as
neither are, nor ever have been.</p>

<p class='c009'>This I speak not in prejudice to Travelling
it self, which, if rightly understood,
is certainly the greatest Improvement in
the World, and I could heartily wish I had
had the opportunity of its Advantage, but
on the contrary I do it chiefly to show that
it is not impossible to give a tolerable, if
not the best Account of the Ancients without
it; for what can any one, who now
travels into <i>Egypt</i>, learn or see but such a
ruin’d Country, that the very Place is
hardly known where those wonderful Cities
<i>Thebes</i> and <i>Memphis</i> stood, except what
is Traditional or extracted from the Writings
of the Ancients. ’Tis true, the learn’d
and accurate Mr. <i>Greaves</i> has given us the
best Description of the <i>Pyramids</i>, but then
this was both because they are at this Day
in being, and to be view’d by Travellers, as
also that he carry’d along with him the
best contriv’d Instruments for taking their
exact Altitudes and Dimensions, which
few besides that see them trouble themselves
with, but are content to say, they
have seen them; nevertheless <i>Greaves</i> can
neither give us the Names of the right
Founders of them, nor any certainty whether
there were perpetual <i>burning Lamps</i>
in them, or a <i>Colossus</i> or <i>Statue</i> on the top of
the bigger <i>Pyramid</i>, or, in a word, by whom
and to what end the monstrous Figure of
the <i>Sphinx</i> was built.</p>

<p class='c009'>But however the aforesaid Reflections
are not the only Discouragements to Industry
and Study; to see our Profession
over-run by <i>Quacks</i> and <i>Mountebanks</i>,
and that <i>Valet de Chambres</i> are suffer’d to
Bleed, dress Wounds, cut Fontanells, and
perform the like Operations, is what has
reduc’d <i>Surgery</i> to so low an ebb. In like
manner the noble <i>Art of Embalming</i> has been
intirely ruin’d by the <i>Undertakers</i>, as also
the <i>Court of Honour</i> much prejudic’d,
of which Your Lordship has been twice
Supreme Judge; from whence it is the
<i>Balsamic Art</i> is now-a-days look’d upon as a
very insignificant Thing, and not a little
despis’d, whereas the Knowledge and Practise
of that <i>Art</i> is both useful in Natural
<i>Phylosophy</i>, <i>Physiology</i>, <i>Physic</i>, <i>Surgery</i> and <i>Anatomy</i>,
as I hope I have fully prov’d in the
body of my Book, over and above that
the History thereof leads us into the first
and best Antiquities of the World. Your
Lordship therefore being both a great
Admirer and Encourager of Things of
this nature, I hope, thro’ Your generous
Protection, not only to secure my self
against the contempt of all Critics, but
also to be enabl’d to continue and complete
my intended Work, and this has also
been one Reason why I have thus vindicated
<i>Surgery</i>, the <i>Art of Embalming</i> and
my own <i>Collection</i>; in which, altho’ I am
not thoroughly satisfy’d that there is any
thing worthy Your Lordship’s perusal, yet
this I am sure of, that Your Candour will
appear the greater, by condescending to
accept my mean Performance.</p>

<p class='c009'>And here, my Lord, I have the temptation
to loose my self in the Field of Your
Praises, but that I know both my Patron
and my self too well to indulge the agreeable
Contemplation. Were Your Lordship
like common Patrons, I should do like common
Dedicators, speak of the admirable
Temperance of Your Life, Your Moderation,
the Wonders of Your Conduct when
You were <i>Lord High Admiral</i>, which Office
was Administer’d by Your Lordship to the
Universal Content and Satisfaction, both of
the Merchant, the Officers and Sailers;
Your Lordship’s Prudence, Judgment and
Sincerity in Your high Post of <i>President</i> of
Her Majesties most Honourable Privy
Council: And I might extend my Considerations
even to the great Happiness such
a Person must possess, who is so generally
valu’d and esteem’d both by his Queen and
Country; but what is so well known I
shall leave as wanting not the help of any
Panegyric to make it more evident, and
content my self with the Honour and Satisfaction
of being permitted to Subscribe
my self, <i>My Lord</i>,</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'><i>It is not only the Authority of King</i> Solomon,

of Men, that convinces us</i> There is
nothing new under the Sun, <i>but

<p class='c009'><i>It is the same with Books and Writings; for
tho’ public Advertisements do daily inform us,
that some Work or other is continually on the
Stocks, yet is it but the same Story inculcated
over again, in another Language, different Volume,
larger Print, additional Sculptures, and
some new Alterations; or else it is but a Translation,
with Annotations, Comments, and a Table
annex’d, which serve for new Amusements and
the Maintenance of the Booksellers. Others which
bear a greater Repute in the World, as being
penn’d by the more Learned and Ingenious Persons,
in a very Concise and Elegant Stile, are
generally nothing but some new fine-spun</i> Virtuosi
<i>Suggestions, extracted from an almost forgotten
and out-of-fashion</i> Hypothesis, <i>and
each Improvement in Modern Arts, has undoubtedly
ow’d its Original to somewhat hinted
to us by the Ancients</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span><i>All this I freely acknowledge to be my own
Case, with this difference only, that I know my
self deficient in that solid Learning and admirable
Stile they were wont to use; yet for your
encouragement to peruse this Treatise, I can
assure you, you shall hardly find any other Book
which so generally, particularly and completely
handles this Subject: Besides, I can justly aver
that I devis’d and compil’d the greatest part
thereof before I met with any Author that gave
me so much Satisfaction as I have since had;
and notwithstanding my Notions were in a great
measure agreeable to theirs, tho’ unknown to me,
yet will I modestly submit and attribute the Invention
thereof to them</i>, First, <i>As being my Seniors,
and who Wrote before me, and</i>, Secondly,
<i>as infinitely the more Learn’d and
better Qualify’d Writers. Nor does this Submission
detract the least from my Labour, it having
been to me the same thing as a</i> lost Art:
<i>And I would gladly be inform’d, by any one at
this Day, of the true Method of the antient</i>
Egyptian Embalming; <i>nay, would be content
only to know the more Modern, tho’ more
excellent Way, that of</i> Bilsius.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>We must therefore grant that the Ancients
knew many Things, which in process of Time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>either thro’ Fire, Inundations, hostile Invasions,
or other Accidents and Devastations, have intirely
perish’d, and still remain so, as</i> Pancirollus
<i>fully shews; or if we have any superficial
Knowledge of them, as is somewhat apparent
from our Modern Architecture, Sculpture,
Painting</i>, &amp;c. <i>yet are we even at this present
so vastly deficient in the very best of our Imitations,
that none have ever hitherto arriv’d to any
tolerable Perfection; nevertheless should any one
so perfectly apply himself to the Study of one of
those</i> lost Arts, <i>as to make a new Discovery
therein, I hope you would allow him the same
Praise as if he had been the first Inventor; and,
for my part, however I should fail in answering
your Expectation, of what is seemingly promis’d
in the</i> Title-Page; <i>yet, thus far I am pretty
sure, that I have given more light into the
Matter, than has been done by any of those imperfect
Accounts of</i> Herodotus, Diodorus
Siculus, <i>&amp;c. And tho’ some Things that I say
may seem to want Authority, yet for the most part,
should I have made all the Quotations I could
have brought to prove my Assertions, it would
have extended this Volume to a much larger
size than I intended; wherefore I have in a great
measure designedly omitted them, to the end I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>might avoid Prolixity as much as possible, and
in other places I have us’d their Words expresly
as my own, not to detract from them, but
to be more concise, and have in several places not
mention’d their Names, for the aforesaid Reasons:
So I do here, once for all, with submission,
Apologize for my self, that the censorious World
may not repute me an ungrateful</i> Plagiary.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>I acknowledge therefore this my Labour, in one
respect to be a Collection, in all to be still deficient
of that Perfection which so noble an</i> Art <i>deserves;
yet in some Things I have improv’d it, and in
others apply’d it to those Uses which have scarce
before been thought of. But all the Satisfaction
I have herein, is to think that I have perform’d
my Duty, in exerting my small Talent, with the
utmost Care and Diligence, for the Benefit of our</i>
Company; <i>and if my Work does not perform
what is intended and desir’d, it will nevertheless
be Useful, Pleasant, and serve to Divert you,

      <div class='line'>SIR,</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Surgery</i> the Chief of <i>Art</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>If the Excellency of any <i>Art</i> consist only in its
Usefulness, or if it derive its Preeminence from
the Object, with which it converses, it necessarily
must follow, That the Profession of <i>Surgery</i>
is the Chief of <i>Arts</i>, since it is employ’d about so
noble a Subject as <i>Man</i>; and therefore the <i>Greeks</i> have
thought fit to call such manual Operations <i>The Art of
Surgery</i>, which otherwise might as well have been apply’d
to any Mechanick Trade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Has two useful Branches;</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Thence it is <i>Anatomy</i> and <i>Embalming</i> are also equally
to be esteem’d, since they are not only Branches of this
<i>Art</i>, but likewise absolutely necessary to be known by
its Professors; the one informing us of the constituent
Parts of the Body, and the other preserving it for ever
in our Memories.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>One Taught in our <i>Theatre</i>, and the other to be wish’d there, yet <i>Embalming</i> practis’d only by <i>Undertakers</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The first has been Learnedly Treated of by our own
Countrymen, as well as Foreigners, and is admirably
perform’d even at this Day in our <i>Anatomical Theatre</i>;
whereas the last, I know not by what Fate, is surreptitiously
cut off from <i>Surgery</i>, and chiefly practis’d by
ignorant <i>Undertakers</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Author vindicates the Right of it.</div>

<p class='c009'>For the Honour therefore of our Profession, I have
undertaken to vindicate <i>The Art of Embalming</i>, and
will prove it to be no less antient and noble than
<i>Surgery</i> it self. In order to this, I will first shew both
the antient and modern Methods of <i>Embalming</i>, as
practis’d by the most learned and expert <i>Physicians</i>,
<i>Surgeons</i> and <i>Anatomists</i>, and then proceed to detect
the Frauds and Subtilties of the <i>Undertakers</i> or <i>Burial-Men</i>,
to the end the World being made sensible of
their Abuses, may the easier be reconcil’d to a right
Opinion of the legal and skilful Artist; but before I
proceed to acquaint you with any farther particulars,
I shall content my self to shew you the Authority
and Reasonableness of the Use of <i>Embalming</i>, together
with the many Advantages that accrue thereby.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Useful in <i>Natural Philosophy</i> and <i>Physiology</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
First,
I presume, it may not be a little Entertaining, should
I relate how far the Knowledge of this <i>Art</i> may be
necessary in our very Domestic and Culinary Affairs,
such as, Tanning, Painting, Dying, Brewing, Baking,
<i>&amp;c.</i> as also in Confectionery, by Conserving all sorts
of Roots, Herbs and Fruits, and Preserving Wines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and Juices; for this <i>Art</i> being grounded as well on
<i>Natural Philosophy</i> as <i>Physiology</i>, it not only teaches us
how to Improve our Drinks, but our Aliments likewise,
and not only to give a grateful Taste in Cookery,
and thereby to whet the Appetite, but also to Preserve
fresh Meats, Fish, Fruits, <i>&amp;c.</i> beyond their wonted
duration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Particularly in <i>Anatomy</i>, <i>Surgery</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p class='c009'>These Things however I will pass by for the present,
that I may come more immediately to my principal <i>Intent</i>,
which is to shew how a Body may be so Preserv’d,
that by the help of <i>Anatomy</i> we may trace its minute
<i>Meanders</i>, and investigate the secret Passages thereof,
without being hindred by any offensive <i>Odour</i> or contaminating
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruor</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How Useful to the <i>Naturalist</i>,</div>

<p class='c009'>By this <i>Art</i> the <i>Naturalist</i> may be enabled to Collect
and Preserve a numberless variety of Birds, Beasts,
Fishes, Reptiles, Herbs, Shrubs, Trees, with Things
monstrous and preternatural; as likewise those which
are more rare and not appropriate to his own Climate,
and this for compleating his <i>Musæum</i> or Repository
with all the Curiosities and Rarities in the Animal and
Vegetable World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>To the <i>Physician</i>,</div>

<p class='c009'>By this <i>Art</i> the <i>Physician</i> learns the situation and use
of the Parts of Man’s Body, with the several alterations
and changes in the Juices, as well in their healthful
as morbid State; and consequently knows how to
preserve and confirm them free from all Diseases, as
likewise to correct and put a stop to malignant and
putrid Fevers, which otherwise must inevitably destroy
the sick and weak Patient.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>To the <i>Surgeon</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>By this <i>Art</i> the <i>Surgeon</i>, in a rightly prepar’d Skeleton,
sees the natural Position of the Bones, and proper
Motions of each Part, with the true and natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Schemes of the Veins, Arteries, Nerves and other curious
Preparations; which not only teach him the
difference between the Muscles, the <i>similar</i>, <i>dissimilar</i>,
and <i>containing</i> as well as <i>contained</i> Parts of the
Body; but likewise how, in performing each Operation,
he should skilfully avoid Cutting what he should
not, and destroying the Function of that he is to relieve.
He is also hereby instructed what Remedies may
be found out against <i>Gangrenes</i>, <i>Sphacelus</i> and other
Distempers that are judg’d Incurable without being
extirpated by Knife or Fire: Who then can sufficiently
admire and value this Noble <i>Art of Embalming</i> since it
tends to the Conservation both of Life and Limb?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Anatomy</i> deficient without it.</div>

<p class='c009'>For tho’ <i>Anatomy</i> gives us an Insight into these
Things in general, yet is it deficient without the <i>Balsamic
Art</i>, in as much as it can neither so particularly
nor frequently shew us, what in conjunction with it,
may without any offence be Contemplated at any
Time, and as often as we please.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How useful in <i>Divinity</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus may we entirely conquer and accomplish that
<i>Delphian</i> Oracle, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γνῶθι σεαυτὸν</span>, by making most of our
Disquisitions into Human Nature by <i>Dissections</i>: And
tho’ Brutes may sometimes be useful in <i>Comparative
Anatomy</i>, yet Man being the <i>Epitome</i> and Perfection
of the <i>Macrocosm</i>, his Body shews a more wonderful
Mechanism than all other Creatures can do, as one
thus very elegantly expresses in Latin: <i>Hominem</i> (says
he) <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a <em class='gesperrt'>DEO</em> post reliqua factum fuisse; ut <em class='gesperrt'>DEUS</em> in
ipso exprimeret, sub brevi quodam Compendio, quicquid
diffuse ante fecerat</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What accounted by this Age and what by the <i>Antients</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The present Age therefore accounts the chief Use
of this <i>Art</i> to be in <i>Anatomical</i> Preparations; but I
shall shew another more antient and more general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>which is the Preserving a Human Dead Body entire,
and which is properly term’d <i>Embalming</i>: More antient,
I say, as having been first devis’d and practis’d
by the Wise and Learned <i>Egyptians</i>, and more general
in that it relates to every particular Person, yet is it by
most despis’d and look’d on meerly as an unnecessary
expensive Trouble; so that unless I can convince these
People to the contrary, I must not expect to find my
ensuing Labours meet with any Favour. But before
I affirm <i>The Art of Embalming</i> to be a particular part
of that Duty, which obliges all Mankind to take care
of their Dead,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Right of Burial and Funeral Ceremonies.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I shall give some cogent Reasons to
prove the Right of Burial, what Things are necessary
thereto, whether Ceremonies are needless and superstitious,
or Monuments vain-glorious, <i>&amp;c.</i> and this
shall be as Nature dictates, the Law of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> appoints,
and the Law of Nations directs and obliges.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sepulture</i> a Debt to Nature.</div>

<p class='c009'>First, <i>Sepulture</i> is truly and rightly accounted to be
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Naturæ</span></i>, by reason the very condition of Human
Nature admonishes us, that the spiritless Body should be
restor’d to the Earth, from whence it was deriv’d; so
that it only pays that Debt of its own accord, which
otherwise Nature would require against its Will. Thus,
in the beginning of the World, so soon as <i>Adam</i> had
transgressed,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Ordain’d by GOD himself.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> said to him, <i>Gen.</i> 3. 19. <i>Thou shalt
return to the Ground, from whence thou wert taken; for
Dust thou art, and unto Dust thou shalt return</i>. Whence
<cite>Ecclesiastes</cite>, 12. 7. says, <i>The Dust shall return to the Earth
as it was: and the Spirit to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> who gave it</i>. Likewise
patient <i>Job</i> thus expresses himself, <i>Job</i> 1. 21. <i>Naked
came I out of my Mothers Womb</i> (which <i>David</i> also calls
the <i>Lowest part of the Earth</i>, Psalm 139. 15.) <i>and
naked shall I return thither</i>. Upon which <i>Quenstedt</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>thus Comments, <i>p.</i> 10. De Sepult. vet. <i>He shall not
return again into his Mothers Womb, but unto the Earth
which is the Mother of all Things</i>. Upon which occasion
read also <cite>Ecclesiasticus</cite>, 40. 1.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Practis’d by the <i>Heathens</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Hence it is the <i>Heathens</i> have generally follow’d the
same Custom of restoring the Dead to their Mother
Earth; since it is but according to the course of Nature,
for all Things to return at last to their first Principles,
and that so soon as ever a Disunion or Dissolution
of the Parts of Man’s Body shall be caused by
Death. That each Thing has ever immediately requir’d
what it gave, is excellently describ’d by <i>Euripides</i>,
in one of his <i>Tragedies</i> call’d the <i>Supplicants</i>, where
he introduces <i>Theseus</i> Talking after this manner:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Asserted in the <i>Scripture</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Hereby it plainly appears that we really possess nothing
of our own, and what we seem to enjoy, is
but only lent us for a season, and must be restor’d
again when ever we die, which is agreeable to that
Expression of <i>Job</i>, in the latter part of the above-mentioned
Verse and Chapter. <i>The Lord gave, and
the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the
Lord.</i> Also Holy <i>David</i>, Psalm 146. 4. (speaking of
Man’s Frailty and Mortality) says, <i>His Breath goes
forth, he returns to his Earth</i>. Here he emphatically
calls it <i>his Earth</i>, both because he was made of it,
<i>Gen.</i> 2. 27. and must return to it again, <i>Gen.</i> 3. 19.
and by reason he has a Right to a Burial-Place in it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Confirm’d by the <i>Philosophers</i> and <i>Poets</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The same is likewise Taught us by <i>Cicero</i>, where
he says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reddenda Terra Terræ</span></i>: <i>That the Earth</i> (meaning
Man’s Body) <i>must be restor’d to its Earth</i>; which
also gave occasion to the antient Philosophers to contemplate
the Beginning and End, or the Life and
Death of Man, that thereby they might be the better
able to Teach us what we really are in Nature, and
how little we have to Boast of: The very Thought of
which put an old Poet into a Passion and Admiration,
expressing himself thus in gingling <i>Monkish</i> Verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum Fæx, cum Limus, cum Res vilissima simus,</span></i></div>

</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Man who is made of <i>Earth</i>, Can he be vain</div>
      <div class='line'>And know he must return to <i>Earth</i> again?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Methinks the very Consideration of this should cause
us to lay aside all Pride and Vanity, and serve for a
perpetual Memorial of Humility and Obedience to
our <i>Creator</i>, who as he was pleas’d to endue us with
Rational Souls, and to give us Dominion over all
Things here below, yet, that we might not be thereby
puffed up and tempted to forget him, he wisely
formed us of the <i>Dust</i>, and, in his good Time, will
reduce us to <i>Dust</i> again. Thence Divine <i>Plato</i> assures
us, that the End and Scope of his Philosophy was
only <i>The Consideration of Death</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its Rise and Antiquity.</div>

<p class='c009'>In Obedience therefore to the Laws both of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>
and Nature, <i>Sepulture</i> undoubtedly was at first Instituted,
and if either Antiquity or universal Custom
can prove a convincing Argument, you may account
it as antient as the World it self, and us’d by all Nations
tho’ perhaps in different manners; for you must allow,
so soon as Death came in by Man’s Transgression, it
necessarily follow’d that some care must have been taken
to Bury his Carcass. The first Instance of this that
we read of, in the Sacred History of the old Testament,
is how <i>Abraham</i>, the Father of the <i>Faithful</i>, Buried
his Wife <i>Sarah</i> in the Cave of the Field <i>Machpelah</i>,
which he had bought of the Sons of <i>Heth</i> for a Burying-Place
for his Family, <i>Gen.</i> 23. 19, 20. There
also St. <i>Jerome</i> asserts <i>Adam</i> the first Man was Buried;
and <i>Nicolaus Lyranus</i> and <i>Alphonsus Tostatus</i> are of
Opinion the Four Patriarchs were Buried there likewise
with their Wives, <i>Eve</i>, <i>Sarah</i>, <i>Rebecca</i> and <i>Lea</i>,
all which you may find explain’d more at large in
<cite>Quenstedt</cite>, p. 2, 3, 4.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Cause of it.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now this seems to have been one of the <i>first Causes of
Interment</i>, to wit, that it being the course of Nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>for Bodies depriv’d of Spirit or Life to corrupt or stink;
and the Medicinal Art being little known and less
us’d in those early Days (without the Knowledge of
which it was impossible to preserve them) there remained
no other way of securing the Living from
the pestiferous Exhalations of the Dead, than by burying
their Carcasses in the Earth, and so removing such
miserable Objects out of their sight; which seems
clearly intimated by the aforesaid Example of <i>Abraham</i>,
when, being in much trouble for the Loss and Death
of <i>Sarah</i> his <i>Delight</i>, he spake thus unto the Sons of
<i>Heth</i>, Gen. 23. 4. <i>Give me a Possession of a Burial-Place
with you, that I may Bury my Dead out of my Sight.</i> (LXX.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάψω τὸν<a id='t9'></a> νεκρόν μου, ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ</span>) where it is to be observ’d, that
he no longer calls her his Wife, but his Dead; as
knowing that those alterations, which she must in a
few Days inevitably undergo, would have deterr’d him
from the very Thoughts of her, if he had not earnestly
sought for and obtain’d a <i>Burying-Place</i>, where he
might hide her out of his <i>Sight</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Second Cause.</div>

<p class='c009'>This is to be look’d upon as the <i>second Cause</i> or <i>End
of Burial</i>, to wit, that it being not only disagreeable to
the dignity of our Nature, but also occasioning great
sadness of Mind, for the Living to see what dismal Accidents
and Calamities befall the Dead, that we should
free our selves from the Apprehensions and black <i>Idea’s</i>
such Objects are naturally apt to inspire, by removing
them out of our Sight and Mind, by a timely
Sepulture: For as <i>Demosthenes</i> said in a Funeral Oration,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leniatur ita Luctus Eorum, qui Suis sunt Orbati</span></i>;
<i>By this means the Grief of those, who are depriv’d of
their Friends, is alleviated</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Thought more Beneficial to the <i>Living</i> than the <i>Dead</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So that these two Reasons
seeming to conduce more to the Benefit of the Living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>than the Dead, it has given occasion to some to believe,
that Burial was from thence invented, and of
this Opinion was <i>Grotius</i>, who thus writes: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hinc est,
quod Officium Sepeliendi, non tam Homini, id est, Personæ,
quam Humanitati, id est, Naturæ Humanæ, præstari
dicitur</span></i>; <i>For this Reason it is that the Office of
Burial is said not to be paid so much to the Man</i>, viz. <i>To
the particular Person, as to Humanity it self, that is, to
Human Nature in general</i>. And St. <i>Austin</i>, Lib. 1. <cite>De
Civit. <em class='gesperrt'>DEI</em></cite>, cap. 12. and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lib. De Cura pro Mortuis</span></cite>, cap.
2. affirms, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curationem Funeris, Conditionem Sepulturæ,
Pompas Exequiarum, magis esse Vivorum Solatia, quam
Mortuorum Subsidia</span></i>; that <i>The regulating and management
of the Funeral, the manner of Burial, the Magnificence
and Pomp of the Exequies, were devised rather as a
Consolation to the Living than any Relief to the Dead</i>.
But <i>Seneca</i>, Lib. 1. <cite>De Remed.</cite> hath more plainly confirm’d
both the foregoing Reasons, saying, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non Defunctorum
Causa, sed Vivorum inventa est Sepultura, ut
Corpora &amp; Visu &amp; Odore fœda submoverentur</span></i>; <i>Burial
was found out not so much for the sake of the Dead as the
Living, that by means thereof Bodies noisom both to Sight
and Smell might be remov’d</i>: Therefore <i>Andrew Rivet</i>,
in his 19th <i>Exercise</i>, on the 23 Chap. of <cite>Genesis</cite>, commends
<i>Sepulture</i> as a laudable Custom, pertaining to
common Policy and Honesty. Human Nature would
be asham’d to see Man, the Master-Piece of the Creation,
left unregarded or lye unburied and naked, expos’d
to the Insults of all Creatures, and become a
Herritage to the most vile Worms and Serpents, or
lye Rotting like Dung upon the face of the Earth; so
that if Pity and Compassion will not move our obdurate
Hearts to Bury him, the very Stench and Corruption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of the Dead will compel us to it. Hence
<i>Chytræus</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus inane Animæ, tandem Fætore maligno,</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A se abigit Cunctos</span></i>——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A breathless Body, tho’ our Pity fails</div>
      <div class='line'>To make us Bury it, its Stench prevails.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>By these two fore-going Causes of Burial appears
yet a farther Benefit to Mankind, that they may live
without that continual Terror of Death,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Frees from the <i>Terror</i> of <i>Death</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which is occasion’d
by seeing such miserable Emblems of Mortality.
If you do but consider, when Men at first
liv’d dispers’d, the very Abhorrence and Detestation of
meeting Dead Bodies, made them to remove such
unpleasant Objects out of their sight: Afterwards,
when they assembl’d together and built Cities to dwell
in, they used Burial for this Reason says <i>Lilius Gyraldus</i>,
Lib. <cite>De var. Sepult. Ritu.</cite> pag. 4. <i>That the Living
might not be infected by the most noisom stench of the Dead</i>.
The before-going Arguments for Interment have been
deduc’d from Natural and Political Reasons, but the latter
likewise relating to Physic, and particularly conducing
to the Health and long Life of Man (since <i>The Art
of Embalming</i> was not known in those Days) we will
a little more accurately enquire into the pernicious
Effects of <i>Putrefaction</i>, and the fatal Consequences
that from thence ensue; for this being the most potent
Enemy to Life,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>From <i>Putrefaction</i> the <i>Enemy</i> of <i>Life</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nature is very careful to expel it
so soon as ever she perceives, by its odious Scents, its
invisible Approaches: Nor can she endure the lesser
ill Scents of Sweat or Urine, or those Excrements of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the Belly, which are necessarily produc’d from the Aliments
of the Body, but the Body it self as well as
Spirits reject them; for this is to be observ’d, that the
Excrements and Putrefactions of all Creatures smell
worst and are most offensive to their own <i>Species</i>,
which we may see by Cats, which voiding a more than
ordinary fetid Dung, always take care to bury it.
And such cleanliness of Living renders all Creatures
the more Healthful, as we daily find by Birds, Pigeons,
Horses, Dogs, <i>&amp;c.</i> which thrive best when their Houses,
Stables and Kennels are kept sweetest. There is
not only an unhealthy, but oftentimes a secret poysoning
Quality in the fetid Odours of a putrid Air,
which are made so malignant by Bodies corrupt and
exposed therein; and thus, in several Countries,

great
Plagues have been occasion’d only by the Putrefaction
of prodigious swarms of dead Grasshoppers and Locusts
cast up on heaps. Thus, the <i>Scripture</i> testifies,
the Land of <i>Egypt</i> was corrupted with Lice, Flies,
Frogs and Locusts as a Punishment to <i>Pharaoh</i>: The
Fish of the Rivers died, and the Waters stank; also
there was a Murrain among the Beasts, and a Plague
of Boils and Blains among the Inhabitants, <i>Exod.</i>
chap. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>

<p class='c009'>The infectious Atoms of a putrid Air are so very
subtile and invisible, that they meet with an easie
reception into the Brain and Lungs, as often as we
breath, and thereby immediately occasion in the Brain
either an Apoplexy or <i>Delirium</i>, a <i>Syncope</i> to the Spirits,
a general Convulsion of the Nerves, or else more
slowly corrupt the Blood, by mixing with it in its
passage thro’ the Lungs, where they either produce
Imposthumes, Ulcers, Consumptions or <i>Hectic</i>-Fevers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>which prey upon the Spirits and Vitals, or bring
Gangrenes to the extreamest Parts, or the Small-Pox,
Purple Fevers, and other malignant Distempers to the
whole Body; nay, they too frequently prove the very
principal Ingredient of the Plague it self, that inexorable
Spirit which so swiftly dispatches many thousands
of Souls to the other World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Art</i> of <i>Poisoning</i> the <i>Air</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus Poison’d <i>Air</i>, or <i>The Art of Empoisoning by
Odours</i>, is more dangerous than Poison’d Water, forasmuch
as it is impossible Man should live without
Breathing, or subsist in an infectious Air, without a
proper Antidote. This <i>Art</i> has been effectually practis’d
by the <i>Indians</i> in their Trafficks, and the <i>Turks</i>
in their Wars, and was particularly us’d by <i>Emanuel
Comnenus</i> towards the <i>Christians</i>, when they pass’d thro’
his Country, in their way to the <i>Holy-Land</i>. This the
Lord <i>Bacon</i> relates in the 10th Century of his <cite>Natural
History</cite>, p. 201. where he is of Opinion, That foul
Smells, rais’d by <i>Art</i> for Poisoning the <i>Air</i>, consist
chiefly of <i>Man’s Flesh</i> or <i>Sweat putrefied</i>, since those
Stinks, which the Nostrils immediately abhor and expel,
are not the most pernicious, but such as have
some similitude with <i>Man’s Body</i>, which thereby the
easier insinuate themselves and betray the Spirits. Thus
in <i>Agues</i>, Spirits coming from <i>Putrefaction</i> of <i>Humours</i>
bred within the Body, extinguish and suffocate the
<cite>Natural Heat</cite>, p. 74. The same effect is likewise to
be observ’d in <i>Pestilences</i>, in that the malignity of the
infecting Vapour, daunts the <i>principal Spirits</i>, and
makes them to fly and leave their <i>Regiment</i>, whereby
the <i>Humours</i>, <i>Flesh</i> and <i>Secundary Spirits</i> dissolve and
break as it were in an <i>Anarchy</i>, Exper. 333. p. 74.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Also because the <i>Canibals</i>, in the <i>West-Indies</i>, eat
<i>Man’s Flesh</i>, the same Author thought it not improbable,
but that the <i>Lues Venerea</i> might owe its Origin
to that foul and high Nourishment, since those People
were found full of the <i>Pox</i> at their first Discovery, and
at this Day the most <i>Mortal Poisons</i>, practis’d by them,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Consists partly of <i>Man’s Flesh</i>, &amp;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
have a mixture of <i>Man’s Flesh</i>,
<i>Fat</i> or <i>Blood</i>. Likewise
the Ointments that <i>Witches</i> have us’d, are reported
to have been made of the <i>Fat</i> of <i>Children</i> dug out
of their Graves; and diverse <i>Sorceresses</i>, as well among
the Heathens as Christians, have fed upon <i>Man’s Flesh</i>,
to help, as they thought, their wicked Imaginations
with high and foul Vapours, <i>Exper.</i> 26. and 859.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most pernicious Infection, next the <i>Plague</i> or
<i>Air Poison’d by Art</i>, is the Smell of a <i>Goal</i> where Prisoners
have been long, close and nastily kept, whereof,
says the Lord <i>Bacon</i>, we have in our Time had Experience
twice or thrice, when both the Judges that
sat on the Trials, and numbers of those that assisted,
sickn’d on the spot and Died, <i>Exper.</i> 914. The like
would frequently befall those that visit <i>Hospitals</i>, and
other such Places, where either the <i>Leprosie</i>, <i>French
Pox</i> or <i>Malignant Fevers</i> rage, were not the Attendants
dayly accustom’d to it, or did they not use proper
<i>Antidotes</i> to keep them from it. If therefore the
morbid State of the Living only be so pernicious to
healthful Bodies,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Air</i> most <i>Infected</i>

Spirits, that issue from a dead and putrid Carcass?</p>

suddenly exhaling such fetid Odours.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Likewise <i>preserves Bodies</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nay the Lord
<i>Bacon</i> farther assures us, That <i>Burying</i> in the <i>Earth</i>,
which is <i>cold</i> and <i>dry</i>, serves for <i>Preservation</i>, <i>Condensation</i>
and <i>Induration</i> of <i>Bodies</i>, as you may find in his
4th Century of his <i>Natural History</i>, Exper. 376, 377.
But this needs no farther Confirmation, since Bodies
are dug up in every Age perfect and uncorrupt, which
perhaps had been buried above 40 or 50 Years, and
some have been found petrified to a perfect Stone, of
which we shall discourse more hereafter, therefore will
at present proceed to acquaint you with other <i>final
Causes</i> or <i>Ends of Burial</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Third Cause of <i>Burial</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>A <i>Third Cause of Burial</i> is, That <i>Man’s Body</i> may
not be torn to pieces and devour’d by savage Beasts,
and Birds of Prey, which would be a sight wholly unbecoming
the Dignity of <i>Human Nature</i>, as <i>Seneca</i>
observes <i>Lib.</i> 6. De Beneficiis: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter maxima Rerum suarum</span></i>,
says he, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nihil habet Natura, quo magis glorietur</span></i>.
<i>Nature has nothing in the whole Creation of which she may
boast more than of Man</i>: So that it must needs be a
grievous Trouble and Concern to her to see the <i>Master-Piece</i>
and <i>Perfection</i> of all <i>Creatures</i> become thus a
Prey to the vilest of Animals; and that he who whilst
living had all of them under Subjection, so soon as
ever his Spirit is separated from his Body, they should
forget all Allegiance to their late Sovereign, and rebelliously
Tear him to Pieces: Therefore we who are
his Fellow-Creatures, and endu’d with Humanity, take
care to bury him out of the way of such Harpies; and
ought to perform all his Funeral Obsequies with the
same Respect we were wont to show him whilst alive.
Hence <i>Hugo Grotius</i> is of Opinion, That <i>Burial</i> was
invented in respect to the Excellency of <i>Man’s Body</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Taken from the Excellency of <i>Man’s Body</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum Homo cæteris Animalibus præstet, indignum visum,
si ejus Corpore alia Animantia pascerentur, quare inventam
Sepulturam, ut id quantum posset, caveretur.</span></i> <i>Since
Man excells all other Creatures, it was thought unworthy
they should feed upon his Body; for which reason Sepulture
was found out, that this Mischief might be prevented as
far as possible.</i> Likewise <i>Lactantius</i>, Lib. 6. <cite>Institut.</cite>
cap. 12. says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non patiemur Figuram &amp; Figmentum <em class='gesperrt'>DEI</em>,
Feris &amp; Volucribus in Prædam jacere, sed reddamus id
Terræ, unde ortum est</span></i>. <i>Let us not suffer the Image and
Workmanship of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> to lie expos’d as a Prey to the
Beasts and Birds, but let us return it back to the Earth
from whence it had its Origin.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Accounted by us the Fourth <i>Cause</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>So that we will account the <i>Fourth Reason for Burial</i>,
to be the <i>Excellency of Man’s Body</i>, to which we ought
to show the greater Honour and Respect, in that it is
the Receptacle of the <i>Immortal Soul</i>. Hence <cite>Origen</cite>,
Lib. 8. <cite>Contra Celsum</cite> says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rationalem Animam honorare
didicimus, &amp; hujus Organa Sepulchro honorifice demandare</span></i>.
<i>We have learn’d to Honour the Rational Soul, and
respectfully to convey its Organs to the Grave.</i> And thus
St. <i>Austin</i> very elegantly expresses himself, <i>Lib.</i> 1. De
Civit. <em class='gesperrt'>DEI</em>, <i>cap.</i> 13. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si Paterna Vestis &amp; Annulus, vel
si quid hujusmodi, tanto carius Posteris, quanto erga Parentes
Affectus major, nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt Corpora,
quæ utiq; multo familiarius, atq; conjunctius, quam
quælibet Indumenta gestamus.</span></i> <i>If we take so much the
more care to preserve our Fathers Apparel, Ring, and
other Remainders of the like nature, as we bore an Affection
to them, ’tis plain their Bodies are by no means to
be neglected, which we wear closer and nearer to us than
any Cloaths whatever.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fifth <i>Cause</i> of <i>Burial</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>But the <i>Fifth Cause</i> and <i>ultimate End of Burial</i> is in
order to a future <i>Resurrection</i>, and as B. <i>Gerhard</i> asserts,
agreeable to that Companion of <i>Christ</i> and St. <i>Paul</i>
his Apostle, <cite>John</cite> 12. 24. 1 <cite>Corinth.</cite> 15. 37, 38. That
Bodies are piously to be laid up in the Earth, like to
Corn sowed, to confirm the assured Hope of the <i>Resurrection</i>:
And therefore the <i>place</i> of <i>Burial</i> was call’d
by St. <i>Paul</i>, <i>Seminatio</i>, as others term it <i>Templi Hortus</i>,
the <i>Churches Orchard</i> or <i>Garden</i>. By the <i>Greeks</i> it was
call’d, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κοιμητήριον</span>, <i>Dormitorium</i>, a <i>Sleeping Place</i>. By
the <i>Hebrews</i>, <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בית חיים</span><a id='t17'></a>, <i>Beth-chajim</i>, i.&thinsp;e. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus Viventium</span></i>,
the <i>House of the Living</i>, in the same respect as the
<i>Germans</i> call <i>Church-Yards</i>, <b>Gotsacker</b>, i.&thinsp;e. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em class='gesperrt'>DEI</em> Ager,
aut Fundus</span></i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s Field</i>, in which the Bodies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Pious are sowed like to Grain or Corn, in expectation
of a future Harvest. By these Appellations we are admonish’d
of the Resurrection of the Body, and of the
Immortality which is given by <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> to the Soul.
<i>For as they that Sleep awake again, and as Christ who is
the Head arose again, so shall we who are his Members
arise.</i> Hence <i>Calvin</i> (Commenting on <cite>Isaiah</cite> 14. 18.)
says, <i>The Carcasses of Beasts are thrown out, because they
were Born to Putrefaction; but our Bodies are interr’d in
the Earth, and being there deposited, expect the last Day,
that they may arise from thence to lead a Blessed and Immortal
Life with the Soul</i>. Also <i>Aurelius Prudentius</i>, a
Christian Poet, rightly asserts <i>The Hope of the Resurrection
to be the chief Cause why the greatest Care is taken
of Burial</i>, whereof he has most excellently describ’d
every particular Circumstance in a Latin Funeral
Hymn, which being Translated by Sir <i>John Beaumont</i>,
Baronet, into 172 Verses, I will for brevity sake refer
you to <i>Weaver</i>’s <i>Funeral Monuments</i>, pag. 25. where
you will find them inserted, and worth your Perusal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Want of <i>Burial</i> not prejudicial to the <i>Soul</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, we are not to think, tho’ <i>Burial</i> was
ordain’d by <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> as a Work both pleasing and acceptable
to him, and consequently approv’d and practis’d
by all Men, that therefore the want of it, or
any particular Ceremony thereof, can any ways be
prejudicial to a Christian Soul, as St. <i>Austin</i> and <i>Ludovicus
Vives</i> his Commentator alledges, <i>Lib.</i> 1. De
Civit. <em class='gesperrt'>DEI</em>, <i>cap.</i> 11. And that Complaint which the
<i>Royal Prophet</i> makes, <i>Psalm</i> 79. 3. <i>That there was none
to bury the dead Bodies of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s Servants</i>, was spoken
rather to intimate their Villany that neglected it, than
any Misery to them that underwent it. ’Tis true such
Actions may appear heinous and tyranous in the Eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of Man, but precious in the Sight of the Lord is the
Death of his Saints: Neither is our <i>Faith</i> in his assured
Promise so frail, as to think ravenous Beasts or
Birds of Prey can any ways make the Body want any
part at the <i>Resurrection</i>; but, on the contrary, we are
well satisfied that in a Moment there shall be given
such a new Restitution, not only out of the Earth,
but out of the most minute Particles of all the other
Elements, wherein any Bodies can possibly be included,
that not a Hair of our Heads shall be missing.
We read how the Bodies of the <i>Christians</i> (after great
Battels, and the Sacking and Subverting of Towns
and Cities) stood in want of the Rights and Ceremonies
of <i>Burial</i>, which neither is to be accounted any
Omission in the living Christians, who could not perform
them, nor any Hurt to the Dead, who could
not feel them. We may, moreover, find in the History
of Martyrs, and such like Persecutions, how
barbarous and cruel Tyrants have raged over the
Bodies of Christians, who, not content with tormenting
them to Death several thousands of ways, still
persever’d with inhumanity to insult over their mangled
Corps, and at length to shew their utmost Contempt,
bury’d them in the Bowels of rapacious Creatures,
or what other ignominious ways their wickedness
could invent. Nevertheless, we have all the reason
to believe their Souls were receiv’d into Heaven,
and that their Bodies will at the last Day be reunited
intire to them again; after which, Death will have
no more Power over their Bodies than their Souls,
but as St. <i>Paul</i> says, 1 <i>Cor.</i> 15. 44. <i>They will become
Spiritual Bodies</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nor any kind thereof hurtful.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So that in this respect it matters
not after what manner the Body be destroy’d, dissolv’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>or bury’d, as <i>Tatian</i> in his Book <cite>Contra Gentes</cite> says,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quamvis Caro tota Incendio absumatur tamen Materiam
evaporatam Mundus excipit, quanquam aut in Fluviis,
aut in Mari contabescam, aut Feriis dilanior, condor tamen
in Penu locupletis Domini</span></i>. <i>Altho’ the Flesh be
wholly consum’d by Fire, yet the World receives the evaporated
Matter, nay, altho’ I am wash’d to nothing in
Rivers or Seas, or am devour’d by wild Beasts, yet shall
I be reposited in the Store-House of a most wealthy Lord.</i>
Likewise <i>Minutius Fælix</i> in <i>Octavio</i> has these Words:
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus omne sive arescit in Pulverem, sive in Humorem
solvitur, vel in Cinerem comprimitur, vel in Nidorem tenuatur,
subducitur Bonis, sed <em class='gesperrt'>DEO</em> Elementorum custodio
reservatur</span></i>. <i>The Body whether it be dry’d into Powder,
resolv’d into Moisture, reduc’d to Ashes, or evaporated
into Air, is indeed taken away from Good Men,
but still the custody of the Elements is reserv’d to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>.</i>
Some have been accounted a rigid sort of <i>Stoicks</i>, and
void of all Humanity, for this Reason only, because
they averr’d it profited nothing, whether the Body corrupted
above or beneath the Earth. Thus <i>Lucan</i>,
Lib. 7.</p>

he were flung out unbury’d, as he desir’d, the Dogs
would tear him to pieces, he wittily answer’d, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid

<p class='c009'>It may farther be ask’d, Why <i>Plato</i>, <i>Aristotle</i>, and
other Philosophers, famous for Learning and Piety, despis’d
the Rites and Ceremonies of Sepulture? To which
I answer, They did not really Despise them, nor durst
they say they were not to be at all: They said only,
if by chance they were neglected, it could do no hurt.
Nor lastly did <i>Lucretius</i> contemn Sepulture, he only
laughed at those who procur’d it for this Reason, because
they thought there still remain’d a Sense in the
Dead, as you will perceive by these Lines of his, <i>Lib.</i> 3.</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot believe there were ever any Philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in the World, of such obdurate Hearts, as strictly to
deny Burial, tho’ out of a seeming Arrogance they despis’d
it; but that they only pretended so lest their
Antagonists should think the want of Burial an inflicted
Punishment, therefore they were the easier
mov’d, as much as in them lay, to expose them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Why the <i>French</i>deny’d it.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus
<i>Pausanias</i> in <i>Phocic.</i> gives an Instance of some <i>French</i>
who deny’d Burial to the slain in Battel, alledging it
was a Ceremony nothing to be esteem’d of; but the
true Reason they did it was, That they might bring
the greater Terror on their Enemies, and make them
to have the worse Opinion of their Cruelty. It must
be granted, the Dead have no sense of any Change or
Dissolution they undergo, and that it is a ridiculous
Opinion of Tyrants, to think to punish the Body by
mangling it, and delivering it to be torn to pieces and
devour’d; neither do Bodies suffer any Hurt or Damage
in respect to the Soul, after what manner soever
they are bury’d: Yet you must grant these sufficient
Reasons why the Dead should be taken care of, and not
be despis’d and cast away; for as we esteem the Body
the Temple of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, and Receptacle of the Soul, so
ought we honourably to Interr it with those Funeral
Obsequies as are becoming its Quality and Dignity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Right of <i>Burial</i> grounded on the Law of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> and Nature.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now we must look upon Burial to be a Work enjoin’d
both by the Law of Nature and Nations, and
not only by the Human but by the Divine Law; for
the most Barbarous as well as Civiliz’d People of the
World have ever paid some Respect and Observance
to their Dead, tho’ perhaps after different Manners, by
Burying them in the Water, Earth, Air, Fire, <i>&amp;c.</i> The
common Dictates of Nature have taught them to abhor
such dismal Objects and offensive Smells as dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Bodies must necessarily present, and their Religion has
shown them the Inhumanity and Cruelty of neglecting
their Duty to them: Nay, if we look into the Natural
History of Animals, we shall find some of them
excelling Man in this particular, by taking a more
than ordinary Care of their Dead, as is to be seen not
only in Cranes, Elephants and Dolphins, <i>&amp;c.</i> As <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ælian
de Animalibus</span></i>, Lib. 2. cap. 1. and <i>Lib.</i> 12. <i>cap.</i> 6. and
<i>Franzius</i> in his History of Animals, <i>cap.</i> 4. <i>Peter Faber</i>
in his <i>Semestrium</i>, <i>Pliny</i> and others observe, but likewise
in Ants, Bees and other Insects; for as <i>Grotius</i> in
his Treatise, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis</span></cite>, Lib. 11. cap. 19.
rightly observes,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Observ’d by Brutes, <i>&amp;c.</i> as well as Men.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullum est in Homine Factum laudabile,

<em class='gesperrt'>DEUS</em> posuerit</span></i>. <i>There is nothing done by Man
worthy of Commendation, but <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> has imprinted some
Imitation of it even in Brutes.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>A Corps lying unbury’d and Putrifying, is not only
a dismal Aspect to our Eyes, offensive to our Nose,
and ungrateful to all our External Senses, but even
horrid in our very private Apprehensions and secret
Conceptions; nay to hear it but only nam’d, is so very
unnatural and unpleasant to us, that we care not to
entertain the least Thought of Death, even to the deferr’d
Time of our Expiration. What presence of
Mind can enable a Fellow-Creature to behold such a
miserable Object as this, express’d by its dismal Aspect,
deform’d Proportion, fœtid Smell, putrid Carcass, and
the like, and this perhaps of one who was but just now
your Bosom-Friend or the World’s Favorite, a Prince
worthy of Immortality for his Wisdom, Piety, Valour,
Conduct, <i>&amp;c.</i> and justly admir’d for the Beauty of
his Person, Gracefulness of his Mien, and Conformity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>of all the External Parts of his Body, as well as Internal
Qualifications of his Mind? Certainly common
Humanity and Self-Preservation would alone persuade
us to Inter him out of our Sight, or else preserve
him from a State of Corruption and Deformity
by <i>Embalming</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>By both to prevent infection, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>I have before observ’d how Beasts receiv’d the Infection
of the Murrain from a Putrefaction of their
own Bodies; now I will shew you how they likewise,
by Natural Instinct, avoid each other in such like Calamities:
The Sound shun the Company of the Infected,
and they reciprocally separate from the rest to
Mourn by themselves. A wounded Bird leaves the
Flight: A Stag (when Shot) forsakes the Herd and
flies to the Desarts: And every Diseas’d Creature retires
into some solitary Place, where its last Care seems
to be, that of providing for its Burial.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Every Creature takes care of its own <i>Burial</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Reptiles creep
into Holes, and Birds into their Nests, or the Bottoms
of thick Hedges: Rabbets die in their Burrows:
Foxes, Badgers and Wolves, <i>&amp;c.</i> in their Dens, after
which nothing will Inhabit there. So that they seem
to know they shall lie undisturb’d in those Dormitories,
which they took care in their Lives Time to provide
and dig in order to their Interment; like as some
Hermits, who, during their Lives, made their Cave
their Habitation, but when Dead their Tomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>The larger sort of Domestic and Tame Creatures
seem likewise to endeavour this, as much as they can,
as may be observ’d from Horses, Oxen, Sheep, <i>&amp;c.</i>
who when they decline and draw near their Deaths,
seek either the thickest part of a Wood, a Dell or
Gravel-Pit in a Common, or deep Ditch in a Field,
where they may lay themselves down, as in a Grave,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and die: They seem to desire nothing more of their
Master, whom they have all their Lives faithfully serv’d,
than to cover their Bodies with the Earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lesser Tame Animals, as Dogs, Cats, <i>&amp;c.</i> know
they have no occasion to take that Care of themselves,
for when they die, their Master is oblig’d to remove
them out of his House and bury them:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How Insects bury themselves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But as for
Insects, they (fearing Mankind should be regardless
of their inconsiderable Bodies, and not be so grateful
as to take care of their Funerals, tho’ they had consum’d
their Lives in making Food and Raiment for
their Master) seem with a more extraordinary Contrivance,
and admirable Art, to provide for their own
Burial. The little Bee works its Honey-Comb for the
Benefit of Man while it lives, and for its own Sepulture
when it dies; the Comb serving for its Tomb,
and the Wax and remaining Honey for its Embalment,
conformable to that Saying of <i>Martial</i>, in his Fourth
Book and Thirty Second Epigram:</p>

and is as nobly Interr’d, as all the <i>Egyptian Art</i>, with
its fine Painted Rowlers of Cyprus, Lawn or Silk
could make her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other Insects, as Flies, Ants, Gnats, and the like,
which are not dispos’d with Organs to perform such
Works, yet have this in particular, that they can outdare
the most resolute <i>Indian</i>

(when, without any previous

Pyre of a Candle or Torch, and outvie the costly
Embalming of <i>Arabia</i>) when they voluntarily fly into
liquid Amber, and by that means obtain a more noble
and incorruptible Sepulture than any other Creature.

Nay it is
yet further remarkable, that such Brutes as have either
prov’d faithful or loving to their Masters, or
done any extraordinary Action, have been bury’d with
wonderful Magnificence, and had Tombs and Inscriptions

in the <i>Olympick</i> Games, with great Pomp near his own

where he dy’d, and calling it after that Beast’s Name
in memory of him. After his Example, several of the

<p class='c009'>We find in the first Age of the World, says <i>Cambden</i>,
the Care of Burial was so great, that Fathers laid a strict
Charge on their Children, concerning translating their
Bodies to their Graves, every one being desirous to
return in <i>Sepulchra Majorum</i>, into the Sepulchres of
his Ancestors. Thus those Holy Patriarchs, <i>Abraham</i>,
<i>Isaac</i>, <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Joseph</i> and the rest, did not only lay the
heaviest Commands about their being bury’d, but also
about transferring their Bodies to such Places as they
nam’d: So <i>Jacob</i>, at his Death, charg’d his Son <i>Joseph</i>
to carry his Body into the Sepulchre of his Fathers,
<i>Gen.</i> 47. 30. and 49. 29. And <i>Joseph</i> commanded his
Brethren they should remember and tell their Posterity,
that when they went away into the Land of Promise,
they should carry his Bones along with them,
<i>Gen.</i> 50. 25. Now this Filial Care was not only their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>last and greatest Duty to their Parents,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Burial</i> a Work acceptable to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but also a
Work well pleasing and acceptable to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>; an Example
whereof we have in <i>Tobit</i>, who being blind,
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> sent his Angel <i>Raphael</i> to cure him, as a
Reward for his pious Care in burying those who
had been slain by King <i>Sennacherib</i> in his wrath, and
cast without the Walls of <i>Nineveh</i>: But altho’ the
King’s Servants forceably took away his Goods, and
sought to put him to Death; yet when he heard one
more had been strangl’d, and cast out into the Market-Place,
he was so zealous in his Care, that tho’ he
was just set down to Meat, he tasted not of it, ’till he
had fetch’d him up into a private Room, and when the
Sun was set, he ventur’d to make a Grave and bury
him.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To our Saviour.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Likewise our Saviour (being to rise again the
Third Day) commended that good Work of those
Religious Women, who pour’d pretious Ointments,
with sweet Odours, on his Head and Body, which they
did in order to his Burial. Moreover, the Gospel has
crown’d those with immortal Praise that took down
Christ’s Body from the Cross, and gave it honest and
honourable Burial. This signifies, says St. <i>Austin</i>, that
the Providence of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> extends even to the Bodies
of the Dead (for he is pleas’d with such good Works)
and builds up a Belief of the Resurrection, by which,
says he, we may learn this profitable Lesson, <i>viz.</i> How
great the Reward of Alms done to the Living must
be, since this Duty and Kindness shown even to the
Dead is not forgotten of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Burial of the Dead</i> was accounted by the Antients a
Work of <i>Piety</i> and <i>Religion</i>, because they esteem’d it
both an Act of <i>Justice</i> and <i>Mercy</i>:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Act of Justice.</div>

<p class='c009'>Of <i>Justice</i>, in that Earth should be return’d to Earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and Dust to Dust; for, What could be more just
than to restore to Mother Earth her Children, that
as she had furnish’d them at first with a Material Being,
Food, Raiment, Sustenance, and all things necessary,
so she might at last receive them again into her Bosom,
and afford them lodging ’till the Resurrection?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Mercy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
Antients also thought it an <i>Act of Mercy</i> to hide the
Dead in the Earth, that the Organs of such Divine
Souls might not be torn and devour’d by wild Beasts,
Birds, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Cicero</i> in his Oration for <i>Quinctius</i> calls
Burial an <i>Act of Humanity</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Humanity.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Valerius Maximus</i>, Lib. 5.
cap. 1. <i>Humanity and Mildness</i>. <cite>Seneca de Benefic.</cite> Lib. 5
cap. 20. <i>Humanity and Mercy</i>. <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>,
Lib. 31.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of Piety.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<cite>A necessary Office of Piety</cite>; and St. <i>Ambrose</i> in
the beginning of an Oration of his on the Death of the
Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, <i>The last and greatest Office of Piety</i>.
<i>Isocrates</i> commending the <i>Athenians</i> for the great Care
they took to bury their Dead, says, It was a mark and
token of their Piety towards the Gods, since it was
they and not Men that had establish’d that Law. Also
<i>Servius</i> observes <i>Virgil</i> call’d <i>Æneas</i> by the name of
<i>Pious</i>, because of the Funeral Honours, he, with so
much Care and Application, had always paid to his
Relations and Friends. <i>Plato</i> speaking of the several
kinds of Justice, has not omitted what belongs to the
Dead; nay <i>Aristotle</i> thought it more just to help those
that were depriv’d of Life, than to assist the Living.
The <i>Latin</i> Phrase also intimates how just a thing it is
to bury the Dead, where it calls Funeral Rites, <i>Justa
Exequiarum</i>, or <i>Justa Funebria</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia justum est</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">justa
facere</span></i>, <i>solvere</i>, <i>peragere</i>. Nay it has no other appellation
in that Language than that of Justice, and in
<i>Greek</i> of a lawful Custom, Piety and Godliness, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>that amongst both the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Grecians</i>, who
have been the two most potent and civiliz’d Nations
of the World, when they would express one had been
Interr’d, they said, they had done him Right or Justice,
and such as neglected to do the like they accounted
void of all Piety and Humanity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Burial the Care of the Gods.</div>

<p class='c009'>And to shew how Religious an Act it is to bury the
Dead; the <i>Gentiles</i> assign’d the Care of all Funerals
and Sepulture to certain Gods they term’d <i>Manes</i>,
whose chief was <i>Pluto</i>, call’d also <i>Summanus</i>, whence
all Tombs and Monuments came to be dedicated, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diis
Manibus</span></i>. <i>Homer</i>, <i>Euripedes</i>, <i>Aristotle</i> and others have
accounted Sepulture an Honour and Reward to Mens
Actions; and on the contrary look’d on all such as
miserable and unhappy whose Bodies lying unbury’d,
wanted that last Happiness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Honour to the Dead.</div>

<p class='c009'>Decent Burial, with suitable Attendants of Kindred
and Friends, according to the Quality of the Person
(says <i>Weever</i> of <cite>Funeral Monuments</cite>, p. 25.) is an Honour
to the Deceas’d. <i>Hezekiah</i>, says the Text, <i>slept
with his Fathers, and they bury’d him in the highest Sepulchres
of the Sons of David, and all Judah and the
Inhabitants of Jerusalem did him Honour at his Death</i>, 2
Chron. 32. 33. Thus in all Ages Burial has been accounted
an Happiness and Quiet to the Mind, and a
Favour from <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, whereas the want of it has been
look’d on as an Evil and Misery, a Curse and Punishment,
a Disgrace and Ignominy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Happiness, Favour and Kindness.</div>

<p class='c009'>First, In the Holy Scripture it is call’d an Happiness,
Favour and Kindness: This was foretold by <i>Ahijah</i>,
and to be shewn to <i>Abijah</i>, 1 Kings 14. 13. <i>And all
Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of
Jeroboam shall come to the Grave, because in him there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>found some good Thing towards the Lord <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> of Israel</i>,
&amp;c. It was accounted a Glory to be bury’d in a Sepulchre,
even to Kings who were laid up in stately
Tombs and Monuments, as in their Beds, and thus
the Prophet <cite>Isaiah</cite> speaks, <i>Chap.</i> 14. <i>ver.</i> 18. <i>All the
Kings of the Nations lye in Glory, every one in his own
House.</i> By the same Prophet <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> comforted <i>Zedekiah</i>
King of <i>Judah</i> when he was taken Captive, telling
him he should never die in War or Battel, or be
deny’d Burial; but that the King of <i>Babylon</i> should
give his People leave to bury him in an honourable
manner, and with such Solemnities as the burning
of sweet Odours, <i>&amp;c.</i> at his Funeral, as they were wont
to use at the Exequies of their Kings, who liv’d belov’d
of their Country, 2 <cite>Chron.</cite> 16. 14. <i>But thou shalt die in
Peace</i> (says <cite>Jeremiah</cite> to him, <i>Chap.</i> 34. <i>ver.</i> 5.) <i>and
with the Burnings of thy Fathers, the former Kings which
were before thee, so shall they burn Odours for thee, and
lament thee</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Especially in the Family-Sepulchre.</div>

<p class='c009'>To die a natural Death, to be lamented and bury’d,
and to lye in the Sepulchre of their Fathers, was ever
accounted a great Honour and Happiness among the
antient <i>Jews</i>, for which the Scripture-Phrase, throughout
the Old Testament, is <i>Sleeping</i>, which implies lying
at Rest and undisturb’d as well as Dying. Thus,
in 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 8. 24. it is said, <i>And Joram slept with his
Fathers, and was bury’d with his Fathers in the City of
David</i>. And 9. 28. <i>His Servants carry’d Ahaziah in a
Chariot to Jerusalem, and bury’d him in a Sepulchre
with his Fathers in the City of David.</i> And <i>Cap.</i> 15.
<i>ver.</i> 7. <i>So Azariah slept with his Fathers</i>, &amp;c. Also, <i>ver.</i>
22. and 28. of the same Chapter, and in many other
places, as 1 <cite>Kings</cite> 2. 10. <i>So David slept with his Fathers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and was bury’d in the City of David.</i> By all this
it is to be observ’d, that in this City was the usual
Royal Burying-Place, where both <i>David</i> and all his
Successors, that were of any Note or Renown, were
bury’d. This appears likewise by 1 <cite>Kings</cite> 11. 43. 2
<cite>Chron.</cite> 12. 16. and 14. 1. and 16. 14. and 21. 1. <i>David</i>’s
Sepulchre was made of such durable Materials,
and so well kept and repair’d by his Posterity, that it
continu’d ’till the Apostles Time (<cite>Acts</cite> 2. 22.) which
was the space of almost 2000 Years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of which Deprivation is a Curse.</div>

<p class='c009'>On the contrary, to die an unnatural Death, and
in another Country, as also to be depriv’d of the Sepulchre
of ones Fathers or Ancestors, was always
esteem’d a note of Infamy and a kind of Curse. Thus,
in 1 <cite>Kings</cite> 13. 22. the seduc’d Prophet, because he
disobey’d the Word of the Lord, was reprov’d by
him who was the occasion of his Error, as he had it
in Command from <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, and withal told, <i>That his
Carcass should not come into the Sepulchre of his Fathers</i>.
<cite>Isaiah</cite> speaking in derision of the Death and Sepulture
of the King of <i>Babylon</i>, which was not with his Fathers,
in that his Tyranny was so much abhorr’d, thus
notes his Unhappiness, <i>Chap.</i> 14. 19, 20. <i>Thou art cast
out of thy Grave, like an abominable Branch; and as the
Raiment of those that are slain, thrust thro’ with a Sword;
and shall go down to the Stones of the Pit, as a Carcass
trodden under Foot. Thou shalt not be join’d with thy
Fathers in Burial.</i> That is, he should want all the
Honours of Sepulture, and all such Funeral Rites as
were to have been paid to him as a most potent King,
and that he should not be admitted to lye in the Grave
amongst his Ancestors, but that his Corps should remain
neglected above Ground unbury’d, and be trodden
to pieces like vile Carrion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>And the Judgment of GOD.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The want of Burial proceeds also from a Judgment
of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, as will appear from the Example of <i>Jehoiakim</i>,
the Son of <i>Josiah</i> King of <i>Judah</i>, whom for his great
Wickednesses, such as Covetousness, Oppression, shedding
innocent Blood and the like, <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> threatned
with the want of Burial (a severe Sentence!) and that
he should have no solemn Funeral or honourable Sepulture,
such as Kings usually have, nay, not so much
as an ordinary Burial among the Graves of the common
People, <i>Jer.</i> 26. 23. but be cast out like Carrion
in some remote Place: And <i>Chap.</i> 22. 19.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To be bury’d like an Ass.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>He shall be
bury’d with the Burial of an Ass, drawn and cast forth beyond
the Gates of Jerusalem</i>, that is, as an Ass is wont
to be bury’d, he being more worthy the Society of
Beasts than Men. The <i>Greeks</i> call the Burial of an
Ass, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄταφον τάφον</span>, according to that Expression of <i>Cicero</i>,
<i>Insepulta Sepultura</i>; and <i>Sanctius</i> expounds it, that to
be bury’d like an Ass, is to be cast out into a sordid
and open Place, which neither covers the horrid and
obscene Parts of the Body, nor hinders the Dogs or
Birds from tearing it to pieces, but as in <i>Chap.</i> 36. <i>ver.</i>
30. <i>His dead Body shall be cast out in the Day-Time to
the Heat, and in the Night to the Frost</i>; that being
so expos’d, it may the sooner putrefie, and become
the more vile and loathsom; and that the sight of a
King’s Body, in such a condition, should be an hideous
Spectacle and horrid Monument of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s heavy
Wrath and Indignation unto all that should behold it,
<cite>Isaiah</cite> 66. 24. Wherefore <i>Ecclesiastes</i> wisely concludes,
<i>Chap.</i> 6. 3. <i>A Man had better have never been born than
to have no Burial.</i> The People of <i>Israel</i> (crying unto
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> against the barbarous Tyranny of the <i>Babylonians</i>,
who spoil’d <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s Inheritance, polluted his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Temple, destroy’d his Religion, and murther’d his
Chosen Nation) amongst other Calamities, thus complain
for the want of Sepulture, <i>Psal.</i> 79. 2, 3. <i>The
dead Bodies of thy Servants have they given to be Meat
to the Fowls of the Heavens, the Flesh of thy Saints to
the Beasts of the Earth. Their Blood have they shed like
to Water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to
bury them.</i> Here the Prophet observes, that <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>
suffers his Church sometimes to fall to great Extremities,
to exercise their Faith before he delivers them;
as at other times he deprives the Wicked of Sepulture,
to bring them to Repentance by such an ignominious
and shameful Punishment. Thus, for the Pride and
Wickedness of <i>Jezebel</i>, the Prophet <i>Elijah</i> pronounces
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s Vengeance against her, saying, <i>In the Portion
of Jezreel shall Dogs eat the Flesh of Jezebel, and her
Carcass shall be as Dung upon the face of the Field, so
that they shall not say, this is Jezebel, and there shall be
none to bury her</i>, 2 Kings 9. 10, 36, 37.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To become like <i>Dung</i> rotting upon the <i>Earth</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By the Comparison
to Dung is shown how odious and contemptible
a Thing it is to be cast out unbury’d, and to be
trodden under Foot, to lye expos’d to the Air and
Weather, to rot and stink or become Food to Birds,
Beasts and Reptiles. <cite>Jeremiah</cite> foretelling the Desolation
of the <i>Jews</i>, acquaints them, <i>Chap.</i> 19. 7. <i>Thus
says the Lord of Hosts, I will cause them to fall by the
Sword before their Enemies, and their Carcasses will I
give to be Meat to the Fowls of the Heavens, and to the
Beasts of the Field, and none shall fright them away</i>,
Chap. 7. 33. <cite>Deut.</cite> 28. 26. Also speaking of their
Kings, Princes, Priests and Prophets, he tells them that
<i>Their Bones shall be spread before the Sun and Moon</i>, &amp;c.
<i>they shall not be bury’d, but be for Dung upon the face of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the Earth</i>, Jer. 8. 2. In other places of his Prophesie
he tells them, They shall die of grievous Deaths and
Diseases, they shall be neither bury’d nor lamented,
but lye rotting like Dung, and be Meat for the Fowls
of the Heavens and Beasts of the Earth, <i>Chap.</i> 16. 4.
<i>Chap.</i> 25. 33. <i>Chap.</i> 34. 20. 1 <cite>Kings</cite> 14. 11. <i>Chap.</i> 21.
23, 24. 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 9. 10. and <cite>Ezek.</cite> 29. 4. Also in the
39. Chapter of the Prophet <cite>Ezekiel</cite> and the 17, 18, 19
and 20 Verses, <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> to shew his severe Judgment,
calls the Fowls of the Air and Beasts of the Field to a
Sacrifice of the Flesh and Blood of the Princes of the
Earth, to eat their Fat and drink their Blood; abundance
more Examples of the like nature the Scripture
affords us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next we will consider what a miserable thing it
was esteem’d, even by the <i>Pagans</i>, to lye cast out unbury’d.
That disconsolate Mother of <i>Euryalus</i>, is not
so much griev’d for the loss of her Son, who was slain
in Battel, as for that he should be made a Prey to the
Birds and Beasts, whom therefore she thus bewails:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sepulture strictly observ’d in War.</div>

<p class='c009'>However, generally speaking, Sepulture was observ’d
as well in Time of War as Peace, to which purpose
Heralds or Embassadors were wont to be sent to make
Truce ’till they could bury their Dead; which if deny’d,
says <i>Grotius</i>, the Antients thought their War
more lawful and just. Thus <i>Hannibal</i>, a sworn Enemy
to the very Name of <i>Romans</i>, is said by <i>Livy</i>, <i>Decad.</i>
3. <i>Lib.</i> 2. to have sought the Bodies of <i>Caius Flaminius</i>,
<i>Tiberius Gracchus</i> and <i>Marcellus</i> Roman Generals,
conquer’d and slain by him, that he might bury
them. Likewise <i>Philip</i> of <i>Macedon</i> is equally to be
commended for his Humanity, in performing Funeral
Rites and Ceremonies towards his deceas’d Enemies;
of which see <i>Peter Faber</i>, Lib. 3. <cite>Semestr.</cite> cap. 13. p.
183. who also gives the like account of his Son <i>Alexander</i>,
in that after he had overcome <i>Darius</i>, he granted
leave to his Mother to bury him after what manner
she pleas’d, and withal commanded the same Honour
to be afforded the <i>Persian</i> Nobles; as also that all such
Soldiers as were found slain should be bury’d with
care, as is recorded by <i>Q. Curtius</i>, Lib. 3. <cite>Valerius
Maximus</cite> likewise, <i>Lib.</i> 9. <i>cap.</i> 8. tells us the <i>Athenians</i>
so strictly observ’d this Custom in their Wars,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Generals put to Death for neglecting it.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that
they punish’d those Generals with Death that neglected

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Others have perform’d it with great Care.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Plutarch</i> in his Lives, informs us how careful
<i>Nicias</i>, an <i>Athenian</i> General, was in this point, for
he commanded his whole Army to halt, while he honour’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>two slain Soldiers with Burial and a Tomb.

<p class='c009'>The <i>Romans</i> in general as well as the <i>Grecians</i> carefully

by whose Law the Enemy was not to be left
unbury’d. Nor must we pass by the Humanity of the

Danic.</cite> Lib. 1. cap. 6. writes, thought it deserving the
greatest Praise, to exercise this Hospitable Piety of
burying the Carcasses of their Enemies, to whom
they bore no farther Malice after their Deaths, but
afforded them friendly Sepulture. Amongst others,
an Example of this nature is fetch’d out of <i>Saxo</i>, a
most eloquent <i>Danish</i> Historian, who in the Third
Book of his History, which he wrote about 500
Years ago, introduces <i>Collerus</i> pronouncing this wise
and elegant Oration to his Enemy <i>Horvendillus</i>, with
whom he was going to engage in Fight:</p>

English’d: <i>By reason the Event of what we are going

<div class='sidenote'>The Ancients fear’d Sea-Burial.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus have the Ancients always provided for their
Funerals, in case they were slain in Battel; but when
they dy’d at Sea, then were they destitute of all such
hopes, therefore dreaded that Element for fear they
should become a Prey to Fish or any Marine Monster,
which was a great check and damp to their Spirits in
an Engagement, Storm or the like. Both the <i>Greek</i>
and <i>Roman</i> Hero’s, who fear’d not Death in Land-Fights,
as hoping the same Place where they fought
might afford them a peaceful Grave, were yet mightily
concern’d and dismay’d at the thoughts of a Naval-Combat,
or when they were in danger of Shipwrack,
and this because they then saw themselves on the point
of being for ever depriv’d of Sepulture. Thus <i>Achilles</i>,
who brav’d all manner of Dangers, could not, as
<i>Homer</i> confesses, keep himself from being daunted at
that of Shipwrack, when he found himself ready to
bulge in the River <i>Xanthus</i>. A like Fear of <i>Scipio</i>’s,
the greatest Captain the <i>Romans</i> ever had, <i>Silius Italicus</i>
mentions, who tells us, tho’ he had so many Times,
without the least concern or dread, seen Rivers of
Blood running down, yet was he most terribly affrighted
in passing the River <i>Trebia</i>, where he saw himself
in danger of drowning. The same account <i>Statius</i>
gives of <i>Hippomedon</i>, who, as he says, could without
any Trouble have presented his Body to the dint of
a thousand Swords, yet was not able to abide the
Thoughts of being cast away in the River <i>Theumesia</i>.
Also that stout General <i>Æneas</i>, tho’ he fear’d neither
Fire nor Sword, yet was so afraid of Water, that being
like to sink in a Storm, he thus exclaims:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>For what Reason.</div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Ancients</i> fear’d to die at Sea, because dead Bodies,
being toss’d to and fro with the Winds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Waves, were often dash’d against Rocks, and never lay
at rest, nay, perhaps were at last devour’d by greedy
Fish, or torn to pieces by the sharp Talons and Beaks
of Sea-Fowls; whereas to rest in the Grave was accounted
the greatest Happiness (whence Sepulchres
came to be call’d, <i>Requietoria</i>) but to be depriv’d of
it the greatest Misery and Punishment, nay the vilest
Ignominy and Disgrace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Want of Burial a Punishment.</div>

<p class='c009'>To want the Honour of Burial was held among the
<i>Egyptians</i> one of the greatest Punishments could be inflicted,
wherefore they deny’d it to executed Criminals,
whose Bodies they gave to the Birds and Beasts,
as may not obscurely be gather’d from <i>Joseph</i>’s Interpretation
<i>Gen.</i> 40. 19. thus speaking to the chief Baker,
<i>Within three Days shall Pharaoh lift up thy Head from off
thee, and shall hang thee on a Tree, and the Birds shall
eat thy Flesh</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hence it was the <i>Greeks</i>, either refus’d all manner
of Sepulture, or at least decent Burial, to Infamous
Persons, or such as had committed any Notorious
Crime. Thus they burned not those, according to
Custom, who kill’d themselves, but bury’d them in an
obscure, ignoble Place, without any Funeral Ceremonies,
Tomb or Inscription. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib. 16.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibl.</span></i> cap. 6. relates, It was enacted by Law, that one
convicted of Treason or Sacriledge should be cast out
unbury’d; which Persons also by the <i>Athenian</i> Laws
were prohibited Burial in <i>Athens</i>, as <i>Xenophon</i> tells us,
<i>Lib.</i> 1. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑλληνικῶν</span>. <i>Pausanias</i> likewise says the <i>Arcadians</i>
cast out unbury’d, without their Territories, the
Traytor <i>Aristocrates</i>, whom they had ston’d to Death.
Among the <i>Romans</i>, those that kill’d themselves were
prohibited all manner of Sepulture, either that others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>might thereby be deterr’d from so making away with
themselves, or because they thought it unreasonable
any Hands should be employ’d to bury him, whose
own had destroy’d himself. <i>Tarquinius Priscus</i> order’d
all such dead Bodies to be fix’d on a Cross, to be view’d
by all the Citizens, and afterwards to be devour’d by
Birds, <i>&amp;c.</i> as <i>Pliny</i> relates in his <i>Natural History</i>, Lib.
36. cap. 15. <i>Albertus Leoninus</i> in his <i>Process. Criminal.</i>
says, If any one kill’d himself (as being either weary
of a tedious Life, or impatient of Pain or Trouble,
or else to avoid condign Punishment, or for any other
Cause whatsoever) his Body was cast out upon a
Dunghill, to have a common Sepulture with Dogs,
<i>&amp;c.</i> but however it was more customary to have his
Goods confiscated, and his Body hung on the <i>Furca</i>.
The <i>Milesian Virgins</i> were deterr’d from hanging themselves
by a Law of the Senate, that Self-Murderers
should be deny’d Burial, and have their Bodies dragg’d
naked thro’ the Streets, in the same Rope they had
hang’d themselves with. All such Persons as were hung
upon this <i>Furca</i> or Gibbet, were by the Laws deny’d
Sepulture, and a Centry, says <i>Petronius</i>, was set to
watch them, lest any Body should take them down.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Burial deny’d to others.</div>

<p class='c009'>Hence also, according to the common custom of
<i>Germany</i>, &amp;c. the Bodies of such as were Traytors,
Highwaymen, Murderers, <i>&amp;c.</i> were either fix’d upon
Poles, set up on Wheels, or hung upon Gibbets, there
to remain a Prey to ravenous Birds, or else to corrupt
with the Sun and Rain, and dissolve into a putrid and
stinking Gore, and all this to the end that others, by
such an horrid and deform’d Spectacle, might learn to
fear and be deterr’d from such like Crimes. He that
commits Treason is by our Laws adjudg’d, says <i>Weever</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>in his <cite>Funeral Monuments</cite>, p. 22. to be hang’d, drawn
and quarter’d, and his divided Limbs to be set up on
Poles in some eminent Place, within some great Market-Town
or City. He likewise that is found guilty
of the crying Sin of Murder, is usually hang’d up in
Chains, there to continue ’till his Body shall be consum’d,
and this at or near the Place where the Fact
was committed. Likewise we are accustom’d to bury
such as lay violent Hands upon themselves, in or near
the Highways, with a Stake thrust thro’ their Bodies,
and this to terrifie all Passengers by that so infamous
and reproachful Burial, not to make away with themselves.
Those that are found guilty of other criminal
Matters, after a little hanging, are cut down and
indeed bury’d, yet seldom in a Christian manner, or
in the Sepulchre of their Fathers, unless their Fathers
like them happen to have their Graves near or under
the Gallows.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difference between Ecclesiastic and Criminal Burial.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Hence the <i>Canonists</i>, says <i>Quenstedt</i>, <cite>De
Sepult. Vet.</cite> p. 49. distinguish between Ecclesiastic or
Decent Burial, and Criminal or Ignominious: They
call that Decent to which Solemnities, Rites and Ceremonies
are allow’d according to the Custom of the
Country, but term that Ignominious which is without
Decency, and where all manner of Ceremonies are
omitted, nay they have not so much as the Tolling of
a Bell, or a Prayer or Psalm us’d for them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Some sort of Burial a Punishment.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus, as some Criminals have been deny’d Christian
Burial, as an ignominious Punishment, so others
by reason of more heinous Offences have been bury’d
alive: <i>Korah</i>, <i>Dathan</i> and <i>Abiram</i> for murmuring and
rebelling against <i>Moses</i> were swallow’d up alive by the
Earth, <cite>Numb.</cite> 16. 30, 33. <i>They and all that appertain’d
to them, went down alive into the Pit, and the Earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>clos’d upon them</i>: But they were not only bury’d alive,
and after that manner descended into a Sepulchre, but
likewise into Hell, as some Commentators observe, for
an eternal as well as temporal Punishment. The <i>Vestal
Virgins</i> being defil’d, suffer’d this Punishment as the
most miserable that could be inflicted; for the <i>Romans</i>
in case of this Crime, bury’d them alive in the <i>Campus
Sceleratus</i>, as <i>Plutarch</i> in <i>Vita Numæ Pompilij</i> observes,
and we read in <cite>Constitut. Crim. Caroli</cite>, p. 131. the
same was inflicted on such as kill’d their Children.</p>

<p class='c009'>To be deny’d all manner of Burial, or to be bury’d
dishonourably or alive, have ever been thought severe
Punishments;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To be dug out of the Grave both a Curse and Punishment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so likewise to be dug up again, after
Christian Burial, is a shameful Disgrace and equally
Ignominious. Thus in contempt of the deceas’d
wicked Priests, King <i>Josiah</i> took their Bones out of
their Sepulchres and burn’d them, 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 23. 16. Also
the Prophet <cite>Jeremiah</cite> foretold the <i>Jews</i> how <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>
would bring out of the Grave the Bones of their Kings,
Princes, Priests and Prophets, and expose them to the
Sun and Moon, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Chap.</i> 8. <i>v.</i> 1, 2. In prophane History
it is reported of <i>Sylla</i> the Dictator, that he dug
up the Bones of <i>Caius Marius</i>, and commanded them
to be flung into the Sea; wherefore when he dy’d himself,
he order’d his own Carcass to be burn’d, that
his Bones might not have the like ill Treatment from
his Enemies, <i>Pliny</i>’s Natural History, <i>Lib.</i> 7. <i>cap.</i> 54.
Such disturbing the Deceas’d in their Tombs, I look
upon to have given the first occasion of burning
Dead Bodies, yet I think this latter as obnoxious to
ill Usage, since it would be a less difficult matter to
deprive Urns of their Ashes, scatter them before the
Wind, sow them in the Sea or barren Sands, or in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>word, make a Paste of them to feed Fowls with, or a
Compost, out of which might be form’d ridiculous
Imagery, to make sport for Children, or diversion for
Men. An Example of both these kinds of the violation
of the Dead, has been known to be acted either
out of Malice to Enemies, or as a Punishment to Oppressors
and Tyrants. The one is conspicuous from
what <i>Saxo Grammaticus</i> relates in the Fourth Book of
his History, that the Body of one <i>Fengo</i> a Tyrant,
being judg’d worthy neither of an Urn nor Sepulture,
his Ashes were order’d to be dispers’d by the Winds, for
it was not thought reasonable that Country should
protect his Ashes which he had depriv’d of its Liberty.
The other is confirm’d by the Usage of the <i>Roman</i>
Emperor <i>Vitellius</i>, who as <i>Suetonius</i> reports, <i>cap.</i> 17.
after various Mockeries, was dragg’d to the <i>Gemoniæ</i>,
cut into very small pieces, and afterwards flung into
the <i>Tyber</i>. <i>Heliogabalus</i> likewise was first dragg’d about
the Streets of <i>Rome</i>, then thrown into a Common
Shoar, and soon after into the <i>Tiber</i>, as <i>Sextus
Aurelius Victor</i> and <i>Lampridius</i> relate.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was another sort of Sepulture us’d antiently,
<i>viz.</i> To be cover’d over with a great heap of Stones,
which was accounted by the <i>Jews</i> an ignominious
kind of Burial,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Another ignominious Burial.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and therefore only us’d to Malefactors,
Rebels, <i>&amp;c.</i> Thus we read when <i>Joshua</i> had taken
<i>Achan</i>, he commanded his People to stone him to
Death, and raise over him a great heap of Stones,
<i>Chap.</i> 7. <i>v.</i> 25, 26. Likewise <i>Joshua</i> commanded his
Servants to take down the Body of King <i>Ai</i>, whom
he had hang’d on a Tree, and cast it without the City-Gate,
raising over it a great heap of Stones, <i>Chap.</i> 8.
<i>v.</i> 29. Thus were the <i>Jews</i> wont to bury such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>dy’d ignominiously, that it might serve as a Monument
to warn others from committing the like Offences.
Nor was <i>Absalom</i> thought worthy of common
Sepulture, much less of the Honours he had design’d
for himself, by the Pillar he had rais’d, but was flung
into a Pit, and pil’d over with great heaps of Stones,
that the Place might be remark’d by the Name of such
a disobedient Son and notorious Rebel, 2 <cite>Samuel</cite> 18.
17. also that his ignominious Death might be suited
with a like Burial; for altho’, in his Life-Time, he
had built a Pillar (like one of the Pyramids or Obelisks
of the Kings of <i>Egypt</i>) in the King’s Dale, <i>ver.</i>
18. a very pleasant and fruitful Place, where the Kings
us’d their Sports and Recreations, and a great Concourse
of the Nobility every Day resorted; there, to
shew his Pride and vain Glory, rais’d he this Pillar, that
after his Death it might serve as a Monument to eternize
his Memory, yet <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> depriv’d him of so noble
a Sepulture, and afforded him no other than to be
bury’d in a great Pit, under a huge heap of Stones, as
a common Malefactor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>And a Curse.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now thus to be bury’d was accounted a Curse, as
is confirm’d by <i>Lamentations</i> 3. 53. and <cite>Ezekiel</cite> 32.
29, 30. From hence we infer, that if some kinds of
Burial denote a Curse and Disgrace, as well as not being
bury’d at all, Funeral Ceremonies and Expences are
necessary to shew what Burial is Honourable and what
Ignominious: Otherwise, if we should find a Carcass
unbury’d and expos’d to the Air, or see a Grave in the
Highway or other Place, where Burial was not us’d,
we should be apt to reflect on this disgraceful Object,
and from thence judge the Person to have been either
some notorious Criminal, a Self-Murderer, or at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>one that had dy’d some ignominious Death, and had
been accordingly bury’d: Therefore, to avoid all such
like Censure, it is convenient Burial should not only be
distinguish’d between such as have liv’d piously or prophanely,
between those that have propagated the
Laws and good Constitutions of a Country, and such
as have wickedly destroy’d them, but even amongst
honest People themselves, according to their Qualities,
Estates and Professions; for should a Cobler and
a Prince be bury’d after the same manner, such Extravagancies
would bring reflection and contempt on
Burial in general, and they might say with the Poet:</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus sufficiently shown and prov’d, that
both according to the Laws of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> and Man, the
Bodies of the Just are not to be despis’d or cast out
unbury’d, I will in the next place acquaint you with
other Particulars,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Particular Ceremonies of Funerals, not to be neglected.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which are necessary to Funerals,
without which a Prince’s Interment would be as ignoble
as a Malefactor’s; nor are we to think a private
burying a Corps in the Night-Time without any Ceremony
or Attendance, can discharge our Duty in
this last and indispensable Particular. We must study
likewise a Method for the well ordering a dead Body,
as Washing, Anointing, Embalming, Dressing, and all
other Expences, Rites and Ceremonies relating to Funerals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in general. In these points, since the Ancients
differ’d very much, it will be material to consider how
far all, or any of these Ceremonies are either lawful,
necessary, or commendable. In order to this, to the
end we may treat of each in its proper place, and be
as succinct as we can, we will divide these Funeral
Ceremonies into such as were us’d to Persons when
they were dying, or else perform’d afterwards to their
dead Corps.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Custom of kissing the Dead.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>First</i>, It was a Custom among the <i>Hebrews</i> to kiss
the Dead, as appears from <i>Gen.</i> 50. 1. <i>Joseph fell on
his Father’s Face, and wept upon him, and kissed him</i>:
whereby he express’d his sincere Affection to his deceas’d
Parent, notwithstanding by his Death he was
for ever to be separated from him, yet his Filial Duty
still remain’d ready to perform those Offices due to
the Dead, such as <i>Embalming</i>, and the like. This
Custom of kissing the Dead seems likewise to be taking
a solemn leave of them at their departure out of this
World, till they should have the happiness of meeting
them in another. But the <i>Romans</i> had a different
Sense of this Matter, for when the sick Person was
just expiring, the nearest Relation or Friend, by a Kiss
receiv’d his last gasping Breath, whereby they imagin’d
the Soul of the Deceas’d came out of his Body
thro’ the Mouth, and was the same way transfus’d into
and receiv’d by them; nor did they only kiss their
Friend and Relation when just expiring, but also when
his Body was going to be laid on the Funeral Pile.
This the <i>Christians</i> imitate now a days, when they
likewise kiss the Deceas’d just as he is going to be nail’d
up in his Coffin, or to be carry’d out to his Grave;
but as for the other Ceremony, they have ever abhorr’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>it as a most superstitious and ridiculous Opinion.
Both the <i>Pagans</i> and <i>Christians</i> without doubt,
look’d on Death as a Journey or Peregrination to
another World, therefore by kissing their Dead, they
took their solemn Farewel of them, as we do when
we part with a Friend that is going to Travel, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Hereupon we always find written on their Tombs,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abiit non Obiit</span></i>, and as <i>Grethserius</i> relates, <i>Lib.</i> 1. <i>De Fun.
Christian.</i> when the <i>Greeks</i> came to a Burying, both
Friends and Relations kiss’d and took leave of the Dead
in these words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vade, cum Natura nos vocaverit, sequemur</span></i>.
<i>Go, when Nature calls, we’ll follow.</i> But let the Cause
be what it will that induc’d the Ancients to kiss their
Dead, it were better totally to forbear it, since to the
Dead they are of no use, and to a dying Man are
rather a Disturbance than any Relief: Moreover, to
the saluting Friend, those ill Scents and Vapours,
which proceed from the Mouth and Nostrils of the
sick Person, may be an infectious Breath, and prove
not a little prejudicial to him; therefore it is in no
wise either convenient or useful to kiss a Person that
is just dying, or one that is already Dead.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Closing the Eyes.</div>

<p class='c009'>The next Thing to be done after the Person was
dead, was to close his Eyes, and this Ceremony was
for the most part perform’d by the nearest Relation,
as by the Husband for the Wife, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et vice versa</span></i>, by the
Wife for the Husband; also by Parents towards their
Children, and by Children towards their Parents, and
where such were wanting, one Friend did it for another.
This Custom was in that esteem among the
<i>Hebrews</i>, <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, that the very Thoughts
of having it perform’d by their Kindred, mitigated,
in some measure, the Pains and Agonies of Death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>they underwent, whereby they dy’d in much greater
content of Mind than they would otherwise have
done; whereas on the contrary, they look’d on themselves
not a little unhappy to die in a Place where no
Relations or Friends were present to perform that
Office. This appears by <i>Gen.</i> 46. 4. where <i>Jacob</i> fearing
he should die in his way to <i>Egypt</i>, by reason of
his extream old Age, or the length of the Journey,
and be thereby depriv’d of these Funeral Ceremonies;
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> to remove those fears and comfort him, told
him, He should die in peace with his Children about
him, and particularly that <i>Joseph should lay his Hands
on his Eyes</i>, as the Text expresses it, which was as
much as to say, he should close his Eyes, and take all
other care of his Funeral.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now why this Custom of closing the Eyes of the
Dead was in such Esteem and Use among the Ancients,
there seem to be two Reasons: <i>First</i>, It being natural
to Men to die with their Eyes open, as <i>Santorellus</i> in his
<cite>Post-Praxis Medic.</cite> p. 18. Philosophically proves; and
Death being compar’d to Sleep, they desir’d to have
their Eyes shut, the better to resemble sleeping and taking
their Rest. <i>Secondly</i>, They might perhaps desire
it, that the By-Standers might not be offended at such
an unpleasant sight as a staring Corps, with its Eyes
and Mouth open, must needs present, which every one
knows looks very ghastly: Besides, the noisom Smells
of the fermenting Stomach were thereby hinder’d
from making too swift a passage into the Room, and
offending the Company. That it is therefore convenient
to use this Ceremony none will deny, yet must
it not be practis’d too soon, lest the Person it is to be
us’d to be not actually dead, but only in an <i>Apoplexy</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><i>Lethargy</i>, or the like, and so by keeping his Mouth
shut with a Muffler, be suffocated. Nor are his Eyes
to be clos’d ’till after he is actually dead, lest they
open again, as <i>Santorellus</i> affirms they will; but this
and other Ceremonies of the like nature, which can in
no wise further Death, in case it should prove only an
<i>Apoplexy</i>, &amp;c. ought to be perform’d before the Corps
be quite cold, for afterwards they are not easily to be
brought to a graceful order, nor will make a handsom
Corps, which the Ancients so much lov’d to see:
Hereupon, in a short Time after the Person was dead,
they clos’d his Eyes,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shutting the Mouth,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
shut his Mouth with a Muffler,
plac’d his Head streight, brought his Arms to his Breast,
his Legs close to one another, and then laid the whole
Body, with its Members, in a natural form and posture.
But before they proceeded to Anoint or <i>Embalm</i>
the Body,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Conclamation,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they were wont to make great noises,
to rowse and awake, if possible, his fainted Spirits, and
thereby fully satisfie themselves whether he were really
dead, or only asleep. To the same purpose they wash’d
the Body with warm Water, to the end that if it were
only numm’d with Cold it might thereby be recover’d.
It was a Custom among the <i>Greeks</i> to make a
mighty Noise with the tinkling or sounding of Brazen
Vessels,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sounding of
Brazen Vessels.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but the <i>Romans</i> us’d Conclamation, or a general
Outcrie, set up at equal Intervals before the Corps,
by Persons who waited there on Purpose, which was
done as <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 7. cap. 52. of his <i>Natural History</i>,
and <i>Cornelius Celsus</i>, Præf. Lib. 1. <cite>De Re Medica</cite>, tell
us, either because they hop’d by this means, to stop
the Soul which was now taking its flight, or else to
awaken its Faculties, which they thought might only
be silent in the Body without Action; for sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>such as have appear’d to be Dead, have come to Life
again as <i>Kirmannus</i>, <cite>De F. R.</cite> Lib. 1. p. 104. affirms,
and several Physicians have given many Instances of
Persons, who being bury’d thro’ haste in <i>Apopletick-Fits</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> have afterwards come to themselves, and many times
miserably perish’d for want of Assistance. For this
reason the <i>Romans</i>, as <i>Pancirollus</i> and <i>Servius</i> observe,
lest they should be bury’d alive, kept the Bodies seven
or eight Days, call’d upon them at Intervals, wash’d
them with warm Water, and lastly us’d <i>Conclamation</i>
before they burn’d them, which was their manner of
Burial. But <i>Santorellus</i> in his <cite>Post-Praxis Medica</cite>, p. 25.
proves <i>Conclamation</i> to be a useless and insignificant
Custom. <i>First</i>, he says, It is ridiculous to use it to such
as we are satisfy’d are really Dead, from the nature
of their Disease and other Symptoms. And, <i>Secondly</i>,
To those that we are doubtful of, as in case of <i>Lethargies</i>,
<i>Apoplexies</i>, <i>Hysteric Passions</i>, <i>Syncopes</i>, &amp;c. Since
therefore this is no certain Rule to inform us, these
Persons being many Times neither sensible of burning
nor large Scarifications, How can we expect to excite
them by Clamours? This also is confirm’d by an Experiment
of <i>Galen</i>’s, <i>viz.</i> Whether a Woman was
really Dead that lay in an <i>Hysteric Passion</i>; but it was
so far from proving effectual, that when she came to
her self, she declar’d she knew nothing of what had been
done to her. ’Tis true in small <i>Syncopes</i> it may perhaps
rowse the Spirits a little, but in Soporous Diseases,
it is commonly an uncertain and ineffectual Remedy,
therefore never to be trusted, so that we may pronounce
it to be a Ceremony neither necessary to be
us’d, nor useful to know whether the sick Person be
dead or alive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Washing</i> the Corps.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The Custom of <i>Washing</i> and <i>Anointing</i> the Corps
was in no wise peculiar to the <i>Romans</i>, but us’d likewise
by the <i>Hebrews</i>, <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Trojans</i> and <i>Christians</i>,
nay, in almost all the civiliz’d Parts of the World, yet
’tis certain it ows its Original to the Invention of the
<i>Egyptians</i>. That it was us’d in the Primitive Church,
appears by the Words of the Apostle, <cite>Acts</cite> 9. 37. <i>And
it came to pass in those Days she (Tabitha) was sick and
dy’d, whom when they had wash’d, they laid in an upper
Chamber.</i> Also <i>Johan. Chrysost.</i> as we find in <i>Theodoret</i>,
Homil. 84. <i>Alphonsus Salmeron</i>, Tom. 10. <i>De Sepultura
Christi</i>; and others affirm Christ’s Body was wash’d before
it was anointed. We read in <i>Plutarch</i>, that <i>Philippus
Libertus</i> wash’d the Body of <i>Pompey</i> with Salt Water,
which perhaps might be either because it was more
Abstersive, or that it help’d to prevent Putrifaction,
and it is not improbable the <i>Egyptians</i> might have
been accustom’d to wash the Body with the same Pickle
they us’d in the Salination, or with <i>Phænician</i> Wine,
which they wash’d the Entrails and inside of the Body
with, in order to the <i>Preserving</i> and <i>Embalming</i> it:
But more commonly the Ancients us’d warm Water,
both that they might thereby cherish and comfort the
benumb’d and lifeless Limbs, and invite the natural
Heat again into the Body, by doing which they better
satisfy’d themselves whether the Body were really dead
or not, and also that if it were past recovery, they
might by thus cleansing the Body from all Filth and
Purgings at the Nose, Mouth or lower Belly, render
the Corps more decorous, and sightly, as ’tis a Custom
among many at this Day, to comb the Hair, shave the
Beard, and perfume the Corps with sweet Odours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two other Reasons are given for washing a dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Body, <i>First</i>, That it might be the fitter for anointing.
<i>Secondly</i>, <i>Johannes Buxtorfius</i>, in <i>Synagog. Jud.</i> cap. 35.
says, That it might be pure and clean when it came
to give an account of its Sins. These Ceremonies were
carefully practis’d among the <i>Jews</i> as well as the <i>Greeks</i>
and <i>Romans</i>, according to what <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maimonides in Tract.
de Luctu</span></cite>, Chap. 4 Sect. 1. observes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos vel Consuetudo
est in Israel, circa Mortuos &amp; eorum Sepulturam, ut
cum quis mortuus est, ejus Occulos occludant, &amp; si Os ipsius
fuerit apertum, Maxillas ejus ligant, ne iterum aperiatur.
Obturatur etiam locus, per quem Excrementa ejiciuntur,
sed hoc postquam Corpus fuerit Lotum.</span></i> <i>It was a
Custom among the</i> Israelites, says he, <i>towards the Dead and
their Burial, that whenever any one was departed, they
closed his Eyes and shut his Mouth (keeping his Jaws
close with a Muffler) that it might not open again. Then
they stopp’d the vents of the Body, and lastly wash’d it.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Anointing the Body.</div>

<p class='c009'>After the Body was wash’d, it was <i>Anointed</i>, which
strictly speaking, was <i>Embalming</i>, and differ’d in nothing
but preserving the Corps for a longer or shorter
space, pursuant to the manner of performing it, the nature
of the Drugs, or composition of the Ointment.
This Custom of anointing the Dead was very common
among the <i>Egyptians</i>, as <i>Pliny</i> in his <cite>Nat. Hist.</cite> Lib. 2.
Cap. 37. writes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Egyptiis Mos est Cadavera adservare Medicata</span></i>.
<i>It is a Custom among the</i> Egyptians <i>to keep their Bodies
Embalm’d</i>, that is, anointed and preserv’d by Aromaticks.
This anointing was perform’d on the outside
of the Body, with a composition of bitter and Aromatick
Ingredients, after which, they stuff’d the inside
with the same dry Spices and Gums as were us’d
in the Ointment; in doing which, and rouling or
dressing the Body, they spent Forty Days. <i>Diodorus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Siculus</i>, Lib. 1. <cite>Bibliothecæ</cite>, No. 91. says, <i>After they
had wash’d the Body with Palm-Wine, wherein Aromaticks
had been boil’d or steep’d, they first anointed it with Ointment
of Cedar, and then with that of Myrrh, Cinnamon,
and other Drugs</i>. This not only preserv’d the Corps,
but also made it fragrant and sweet, and of this Ceremony
the <i>Egyptians</i> were the first Inventors. From
them the <i>Hebrews</i> deriv’d their Custom of <i>Embalming</i>,
which was us’d chiefly towards their Kings or Great
Men. The first of this kind was when <i>Joseph</i> commanded
the Physicians of <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Embalm</i> his Father
<i>Jacob</i>, Gen. 50. 2, 3. from whom the <i>Jews</i> learn’d it,
and brought it with them into the Land of <i>Canaan</i>:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Hebrews</i> Embalming different from that of the <i>Egyptians</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But this manner of Anointing or <i>Embalming</i> among
the <i>Hebrews</i> was very different from that of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
for their Method was Thirty, Forty, and sometimes
Seventy Days in performing, and that by Balsamic
Matters put into the Cavity of the Body, they
first taking out the Bowels and Entrails; but the <i>Hebrew</i>
way was one short anointing and applying Aromatick
and Balsamic Ointments to the external Parts,
without any Embowelling, and this was done rather
out of Respect to, and Veneration of the Dead, than
to prevent any Putrifaction. Thus we read of King
<i>Asa</i>, 2 Chron. 16. 14. <i>That they bury’d him in his own
Sepulchre, which he had made for himself in the City of
David, and laid him in the Bed which was fill’d with
sweet Odours and divers kinds of Spices, prepar’d by the
Apothecaries Art, and they made a great Burning for him.</i>
That is, they laid his dead Corps on a Bed fill’d with
such Aromaticks, prepar’d by the Apothecary, as were
wont to be us’d in <i>Embalming</i>, and afterwards burn’d
sweet Odours and Perfumes at his Funeral. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>this was accounted very Honourable to be done at the
Exequies of Kings, and was afforded King <i>Zedekiah</i>,
tho’ he dy’d in a strange Land, <i>Jerem.</i> 34. 5. Hereby
it appears, thro’ the length and injuries of Time,
they might lose that Art of <i>Embalming</i> which the
<i>Jews</i>, their Ancestors, had learn’d from the <i>Egyptians</i>,
or else had their Tradition so confusedly left to Posterity,
that they were forc’d to deviate from the antient
Custom; for the best construction we can put upon
<i>Embalming</i> of the latter Ages, was anointing the Corps
with bitter and Aromatick Ointments, compounded
by the Apothecaries,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Jewish Embalming</i> rather a Ceremony than Preserving the Corps.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which nevertheless was rather a
Ceremony, and render’d the Corps sweet and fragrant,
than prevented Putrifaction. Thus the most devout
<i>Nicodemus</i> and <i>Joseph</i> of <i>Arimathea</i> Embalm’d the
Body of Christ, both out of the Respect they bore him,
and according to the Custom of their Nation. Thus,
says the Text, <i>They took the Body of Jesus, and wound
it in Linnen-Cloaths, with the Spices</i> (<i>viz.</i> about an
Hundred weight of Myrrh and Aloes) <i>as the Manner
of the Jews is to bury</i>, John 19. 40. Likewise Holy
<i>Mary</i> anointed the Feet of Jesus, whilst alive, with a
most costly and rich Ointment of Spikenard, which
was done by way of Anticipation in order to his Burial,
as the Words of our Saviour himself imply, <cite>John</cite> 12.
7. So also without doubt <i>Lazarus</i>, who was no mean
<i>Jew</i>, was Embalm’d, nevertheless <i>Martha</i> fear’d he
stunk, tho’ he had been Dead but four Days, <cite>John</cite> 11.
39. Thus you see the more Modern way of <i>Embalming</i>
among the <i>Jews</i>, was only anointing the Body with an
Ointment compounded of sweet Spices, whose chief Ingredients
were Myrrh and Aloes, and which was not only
very grateful to the Smell, but also dry’d up the Humidity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of the Body, preventing an immediate Putrifaction,
and likewise by its bitterness kept the Worms
from eating it. The Custom of such like anointing
the Dead was moreover very common among the
<i>Greeks</i>, insomuch, says <cite>Athenæus</cite> Lib. 15. that they
studied what Ointments were most agreeable and fitting
for every Member of the Body. From them it
descended to the <i>Romans</i>, and was accounted one of
the most commendable Actions of this Life, as being
an Honour which appertain’d to the Dead, as <cite>Pliny
Nat. Hist.</cite> Lib. 12. cap. 1. relates, wherefore after they
had wash’d the Corps, they anointed it, says he, with
Odoriferous and Aromatick Ointments. The <i>Babylonians</i>
either anointed their Dead with, or laid them
in Hony. The <i>Persians</i> and <i>Scythians</i> did the same
with Wax. The <i>Æthiopians</i> with a sort of Parget; and
others us’d Compositions either of <i>Salt</i>, <i>Nitre</i>, <i>Asphalt</i>,
<i>Bitumen</i>, <i>Cedar</i>, <i>Balsam</i>, <i>Gypsum</i>, <i>Lime</i>, <i>Petrole</i>, <i>Naptha</i>,
<i>Turpentine</i>, <i>Rosin</i>, or the like, of which see <cite>Kirkmannus
de F. R.</cite> p. 62.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Anointing</i> the <i>Dead</i> to what purpose us’d.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now the general Intention of these Anointings,
was either that such Bodies as were to be bury’d might
thereby smell sweet and pleasant, and be kept a long
while uncorrupt, or else that those that were to be burn’d
might not only catch Fire the sooner; but also to the
end the Air might be perfum’d by the sweet smelling
Ointments and Balsams, and thereby the Stench of the
burning Flesh not be perceiv’d. Others give a threefold
Reason for this sort of <i>Embalming</i>, as, <i>First</i>, A
Physical, That all Stench and Putrifaction might be
driven away from the Body. <i>Secondly</i>, A Civil, That
it was a principal Honour exhibited to Just Men.
And, <i>Thirdly</i>, A Mystical, It being a Testification of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>our Faith in the Resurrection of Bodies, and a <i>Symbol</i>
of future Incorruptibility. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide Quenstedt De Sepult.
Vet.</span></cite> p. 85.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Attiring</i> the Corps,</div>

<p class='c009'>After the Body was <i>wash’d</i> and <i>anointed</i>, they wrapp’d
it in fine Linnen, and drest it in a proper Habit. The
first is only to be understood a Winding-Sheet, either
intire, or in two, three or more pieces, fitted to the
Head, Trunk and Limbs of the Body, bound on with
Roulers; but the latter was various according to the
sort of Garment, or Quality of the Deceas’d: The
first was usually white, prepar’d by some Woman or
Friend in the Persons Life-Time, on purpose for this
particular use; the other was of divers colours, as Purple,
Scarlet, <i>&amp;c.</i> and of several degrees of Richness,
according to the Rank, Quality or Profession of the
Deceas’d, or as he had perform’d any extraordinary
Exploit in War, or otherwise honourably behav’d
himself for the Honour of his Country. So that as
the one was such as he usually wore in his Life-Time,
the other was more Splendid, and given for a Reward
to his Virtues. Hence it is the Dead were term’d proud,
as having never wore so rich a Garment during their
Lives, says <i>Sosia apud Plautum in Amphitruone</i>. This
Custom is said to have been first us’d by the <i>Greeks</i>,
but if we enquire more strictly into it, we shall find
this, as well as other Ceremonies, owes its Origin to
the <i>Egyptians</i>, tho’ the manner of performing it be
different;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>With fine <i>Linnen</i> and a <i>Vest</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for the <i>Greeks</i> cover’d their Dead from
Head to Foot, first with fine Linnen, and then put
over that a white Vest, which was a sort of <i>Pallium</i>
or Cloak they wore commonly when alive. So likewise
the <i>Athenians</i> and <i>Lacedemonians</i> dress’d their Dead
in a Garb suitable to every ones Condition, and honourably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>adorn’d such as had behav’d themselves well
in War with a Purple or Crimson Vest, as <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alexander
Sardus de Mor. &amp; Rit. Gent.</span></cite> Lib. 1. cap. 25. relates.
As the <i>Greeks</i> put on their Dead the <i>Pallium</i>, so the
<i>Romans</i> us’d their <i>Toga</i> or Gown, conformable to every
One’s degree. That ordinarily us’d at the Funerals of
vulgar Citizens was also white, but the Richer sort, as
likewise those that had acquir’d Honour by their Valour
and Vertue, were more splendidly Attir’d and
carry’d out in State in the view of the Public, so that
any one might know the Face and Sex of the Deceas’d
from the manner of their Cloaths and Ornaments.
Now this was so well observ’d by the Ancients, that as
<i>Juvenal</i>, Satyr 3. informs us, in some parts of <i>Italy</i>,
tho’ the Inhabitants were so rude as not to wear the
<i>Toga</i> whilst they liv’d, yet would they not want it at
their Deaths:</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Also the <i>Jews</i> us’d to wrap their Dead in fine Linnen,
but differ’d from others in this respect, That they did
not hold it lawful to dress the Body of a Prince in a
more costly Garment than others had, and as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cl. Salmasius
apud Tho. Bartholinum de Latere Christi aperto</span></i>,
p. 377. observes, the Body of our Saviour was only
wrapp’d in fine Linnen, his Head in a <i>Sudarium</i> or
Handkerchief, and the whole swathed up from Head to
Foot, with Rowlers like to the Swathes of Children.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span><i>John Henry Heiddegger in Dissert. de Sepult. Mort.</i> Sect.
30. divides this Linnen into three sorts: <i>First</i>, A short
piece, which was call’d <i>Sudarium</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, A longer,
nam’d <i>Syndon</i>. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, That which kept both
these on, bound up the Hands and Feet, and cover’d
the rest of the Body, was term’d <i>Fascia</i> or a Swathing-Band.
This seems clearly intimated in the Gospel of
St. <cite>John</cite>, 11. 44. <i>And he that was dead came forth, bound
Hand and Foot with Grave-Cloaths, and his Face was
bound up with a Napkin</i>: Therefore we are to understand,
as the Evangelist here speaks of <i>Lazarus</i>, that
the Arms were laid close to the Body, so that they almost
reach’d the Knees, and afterwards rowl’d up together
with it;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Why the <i>Body</i> should be <i>Cloath’d</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but it may perhaps be ask’d why the
Body should be Cloath’d at all, and why it might not
be as well carry’d out Naked and uncover’d? To this
<i>Antonius Santorellus</i> in his <cite>Post-Praxis Medica</cite>, p. 104.
answers, That all Nations have taught the Body ought
to be Cloath’d, since no Man has hitherto every been
so immodest as not to be asham’d of his own Nakedness;
for altho’ this seems to signifie nothing to the
Dead, who are without Sense or Shame, yet because
the Eyes of the Living are offended at the Nakedness
of the Body, all have for that Reason thought fit to
Cloath their Dead: Moreover, not only Deformity is
thereby remov’d from a Corps, but we thus procure as
much as possible that it may appear Comely, and besides
’tis more decent to see a Body Cloath’d than Naked.
On this account the <i>Greeks</i> Cloath’d their Dead in
white Vests or Garments,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Why with <i>white Vests</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by reason of the purity of
that Colour, White, according to <i>Plutarch</i> in <i>Problem.</i>
being alone sincere, pure, and no ways infected, so that
the Dead seem to be render’d in a manner simple, pure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and separate from any mixture: But at length a certain
Luxury of Ostentation crepp’d into these Habits,
wherefore the <i>Spartan</i> Law-Giver <i>Lycurgus</i>, order’d
that Persons of the greatest Valour and Worth should
be bury’d in nothing but a red Coat, which was the
common Dress of Soldiers, and that the rest should be
deny’d even that; for he thought it wholly absurd and
unreasonable the Dead should be deck’d with superfluous
Ornaments and Riches, therefore neither Ointments
nor Perfumes were us’d in that Common-Wealth,
being look’d on as conducing nothing to the
Felicity of the Dead, and therefore unworthy of the
<i>Lacedemonians</i> Gravity. Thus St. <i>Jerom</i> inveighs against
them: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cur &amp; Mortuos vestros auratis obvolvis
Vestibus? Cur Ambitio inter Luctus, Lacrymasq; non cessat?
An Cadavera Divitum, nisi in serico, putrescere
nequeunt?</span></i> <i>Why do ye Cloath even your Dead in Cloth
of Tissue? Whence comes Ambition to continue amidst
Grief and Sorrow? Cannot a Rich Carcass, think ye, rot
out of a Silk-Covering?</i> St. <i>Chrisostom</i> also thus exclaims:
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O inanem Gloriam! Quantam in Luctu Vim, quantam
Amentiam ostendit!</span></i> <i>O empty Glory! How does it
exert it self in Grief, how discover its Madness!</i> Likewise
in <i>Homil.</i> 84. he thus writes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu cum audieris Nudum
Dominum resurrexisse, cessa, quæso, ab insana Funeris
impensa. Quid sibi hoc superfluum vult &amp; inutile
Dispendium, quod ipsis, qui faciunt, plurimum affert Detrimenti,
Mortuis nullum Utilitatem vel Damnum potius?
Sumptuosa namq; Sepultura nonnunquam Causa est, ut
Fures Cadaver effodiant, &amp; nudum &amp; insepultum projiciant.</span></i>
<i>Thou when thou shalt hear thy Lord rise from the
Dead, naked and unadorn’d, refrain, I beseech thee, from
thy vain Funeral-Expences. What signifies all this superfluous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and unprofitable Charge, which many times prejudices
the Living, yet never does any Good to the Dead,
but rather Harm? For oftentimes it happens a costly and
sumptuous Interment, tempts Thieves to dig up the Rich
Carcass, and throw it out Naked and unbury’d.</i> Hence
St. <i>Austin</i>, speaking of his Mother, says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Illa iminente
Die, non curavit Corpus suum sumptuose contegi</span></i>. <i>She
with her last Breath did desire her Body might not be
splendidly Interr’d.</i> Notwithstanding this, the aforesaid
St. <i>Chrisostom</i> approves the use of these Things in a
moderate way; for after he had so severely inveigh’d
against them, he thus concludes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non ut Sepulturam
tollam, dico absit, sed Luxuriam &amp; superfluam Ambitionem</span></i>.
<i>I am not for taking Burial wholly away, far be that
Thought from me, but I would have Luxury and unnecessary
Ambition retrench’d.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Antonius Santorellus</i> thinks the Body ought to be
carry’d out cover’d, as well in respect to the Living
as the Dead, to the Living, lest they may be offended
by some small Perspirations of the Carcass, and to the
Dead; lest being uncover’d, it might be more liable to
external Injuries. For this Reason the <i>Egyptians</i>, who
were wont to keep their Dead publickly in their Houses,
richly attir’d them in fine Linnen, and adorn’d
them with Gold and precious Stones; also painted them
with Hieroglyphicks, thereby setting them forth in
the most noble manner. Thus by such a kind of
Cloathing as is us’d in Embalming, <i>viz.</i> wrapping in
Cerecloth, <i>&amp;c.</i> all other Inconveniencies are prevented,
nor can it be thought so great a Vanity to Cloath
a preserv’d Corps as one that is corrupt and putrifying;
but we may allow it reasonable enough to adorn
such in a moderate way, suitable to its Quality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Crowning</i> the <i>Dead</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>When the Body was dress’d, they Crown’d it, which
Custom was first us’d by the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Lacedemonians</i> and
<i>Athenians</i>, from whom it descended to the <i>Romans</i>:
Now if the Deceas’d had, thro’ Valour in War, obtain’d
but any one of the honourary Crowns, it was
put on his Head, and carry’d out with him to his Burial;
and this, to the end the Reward of Virtue might
in some measure be enjoy’d after Death. For this
reason <i>Cicero</i> observes, <i>Lib.</i> 2. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Legibus</span></cite>, That the
Laws commanded that Crown which was gotten by
Virtue, should, without fraud, be put on him that
obtain’d it, and that such Ornaments of Praise belong’d
to the Dead. Other Persons were Crown’d with Chaplets
of Flowers and green Branches, such as Lillies,
Roses and Violets, Olive and Bay-Leaves, and the like
precious Flowers and Plants. With these they likewise
adorn’d the Couch the Body was to lye on, as the
<i>Jews</i> did theirs with sweet Odours and Spices, as we
have before observ’d of King <i>Asa</i>, 2 <cite>Chron.</cite> 16. 14.
Also in like manner as we at this Day fill Coffins with
the like Perfumes, or for want of them, with sweet
Herbs and Flowers, <i>viz.</i> Rosemary, Lavender, Marjoram,
Time, Flowers of Jessamin, Orange, Lillies of
the Valley, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Whence Deriv’d, and to what End.</div>

<p class='c009'>This Ceremony of <i>Crowning the Dead</i>, <i>Suidas</i> thinks
was either taken from the <i>Games</i>, wherein the Conquerors
were rewarded with Crowns of Leaves, signifying
the Dead had finish’d their Course, or was design’d
to express the unmix’d and Everlasting Pleasures
the Dead were to enjoy upon their Removal out of
this sinful and troublesom World, for Garlands were
Emblems of Mirth and Rejoycing, therefore usually
worn at Banquets and Festivals. The same may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>observ’d of Ointments and Perfumes, the constant
Concomitants of Gaiety and Joy. But whatever was
the cause of these Customs being so generally observ’d
by the <i>Heathens</i>, it was not approv’d by the Primitive
<i>Christians</i>, but look’d on as little less than Idolatry, as
may be particularly seen in <i>Minutius Fælix</i> in <cite>Octav.</cite> p.
109. and in <i>Tertullian de Corona Mil.</i> Nevertheless,
<i>Antonius Santorellus</i> in his <cite>Post-Praxis Medica</cite>, p. 151.
says, <i>If Crowns were invented as Ornaments, and to preserve
Health, Pleasure and Virtue, why may not the Dead
be Crown’d? And since those who fought boldly and strenuously,
were among the</i> Heathens <i>adorn’d with various
sorts of Crowns, why may not the</i> Christians, <i>who fight for
Eternal Health, and overcome more powerfull Enemies
(the Lusts of the Flesh) be thought more worthy of such
Crowns?</i> Nor has it displeas’d some <i>Christians</i>, tho’
perhaps it might the <i>Primitive</i>, to carry a Garland before
the Corps, or fill the Coffin, or strow the Way or
Grave with Flowers, and this without any manner of
Superstition. Thus <i>Prudentius</i> a <i>Christian</i> Poet writes:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Laying out the <i>Corps</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The next Ceremony that follow’d, was laying out
the Corps, which after it was Wash’d, Anointed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Cloath’d and Crown’d, was brought from the inner
part of the House into the Porch or Entrance, and
laid at the very Threshold. The poorest People were
laid on the Ground or a Bier in an ordinary Coffin, <i>&amp;c.</i>
But the richer Sort on a Bed or Couch, adorn’d sometimes
with Jewels, Arms, Books and other Things in
which they most delighted whilst they liv’d, but commonly
with all kinds of fragrant and precious Flowers.
Now the Reason why they thus plac’d the Corps in
public View, was that all Persons might satisfie themselves
whether the Deceas’d had any Wounds, or other
Marks of an untimely and violent Death. The like
Custom we have in those we call <i>Searchers</i>, who are
to examine into the Cause of the Persons Death,
make their Report accordingly, and give an <i>Affidavit</i>
thereof: It may be farther observ’d, the Feet of the
Deceas’d were always turn’d next the Door or Gate,
to shew they were never to return after they were
thus carry’d out. <i>This Custom</i>, says <i>Pliny</i>, <i>is but according
to the Course of Nature, for we usually come into
the World Head foremost, but are carry’d out the contrary
way</i>, of which see <cite>Kornmannus de Mirac. Mortuor</cite>, Cap.
58. Whilst the Body lay in this Place, ’twas customary
to give it constant Attendance, to defend it
from any Violence or Affront that might be offer’d.
The Corps being thus decently laid out on the Couch
or Bier, is now rightly compos’d for Sepulture, and
in a readiness to be carry’d out to the Grave, so soon
as these Ceremonies shall be ended; the next Thing
therefore we have to speak of is the <i>carrying it out</i> to
be Interr’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Carrying forth</i> the <i>Corps</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus much was done before the Funeral, at it we
may take notice of two Things, the <i>Elatio</i> or carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>forth, and the <i>Act</i> of <i>Burial</i>. What concerns the first
of these will appear by our observing the <i>Day</i>, <i>Time</i>,
<i>Persons</i> and <i>Place</i>; what <i>Day</i> after the Person’s decease
was appointed for the Funeral is not well agreed on,
nor does it seem to have been limited, but was various,
according to the Custom of the Country, or Circumstance
of the People. <i>Alexander ab Alexandro</i> in
Lib. 3. cap. 7. <i>Gen. Dier</i>, tells us Bodies were kept seventeen
Days and as many Nights before they were Interr’d.
Also <i>Servius</i> was of Opinion, the Time of
<i>Burning</i> the Dead was the Eighth Day after Death, and
the Time of <i>Burying</i> the Ninth; but this must only
be understood of the Funerals of Great Persons, which
could not be duly solemniz’d without extraordinary
Preparations, whereas Men of inferior Rank, were
committed to the Ground without so much Ceremony
and Pomp. The antient Burials seem to have been
on the Third and Fourth Day after Death, nor was
it unusual to perform Solemnities, especially of the
poorer Sort, on the very Day of their Death, yet are
there many Instances to prove no set number of Days
were observ’d; however, this Care ought particularly
to be taken, that the Dead be not carry’d out too
soon, for thro’ too much haste, it has sometimes
happen’d the Living have been bury’d for the Dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Time</i> of carrying forth the Corps was likewise
various,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>By some us’d in the <i>Day</i> and by others in the <i>Night</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and us’d either in the Morning, at Noon, or
in the Night, according to the Custom of the Country,
or Conveniency and Condition of the Person deceas’d.
Thus the <i>Athenians</i> made their Funeral Processions
before the Sun-Rising, and the <i>Greeks</i> perform’d
the like Ceremony in the forepart of the Day,
or about Noon: So also the <i>Hebrews</i> bury’d their Dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in the Day-Time, as <i>Sopranes</i>, <i>David. dig.</i> fol. 487.
asserts; but the <i>Romans</i> made use only of the Night,
as the name of Funeral, <i>Servius</i> thinks, denotes, being,
as he says, deriv’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a Funalibus</span></i>, from the Torches, in
like manner as the <i>Vespillones</i> (Bearers) were so call’d
from <i>Vesper</i> the <i>Evening</i>; yet this Custom was not long
observ’d at least in publick Funerals, tho’ it seems to
have continu’d in private ones, nevertheless, the carrying
of Torches and Tapers still remain’d in practice,
even when the Dead were bury’d in the Day-Time.
This was a greater extravagance than the other, inasmuch
as tho’ in burying by Day they at first intended
to suppress the Charge of Torches, <i>&amp;c.</i> yet at last
they not only burn’d these in vain to light the Sun,
but also increas’d all other Funeral-Expences to that
degree, that Laws were fain to be made to restrain
them; but, omitting such superfluous Ceremonies, we
must grant the Day-Time to be the fittest for publick
Funerals, and the Night for private ones, both which
have been us’d indifferently, as Occasion serv’d, as well
by the <i>Primitive Christians</i> as others: The first were
chiefly chosen whilst they were in a quiet State, but
the latter were made use of in Times of Persecution.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How <i>carry’d forth</i> to the <i>Grave</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now as concerning the Act or manner of <i>carrying
forth</i> the dead Body, from the House wherein it was
prepar’d for Burial, to the place where it was to be
interr’d, it is said of the antient <i>Grecians</i>, that they
carry’d such out without any support, tho’ it was a
more frequent Custom in the antient Church to bear
the Dead on Mens Shoulders; afterwards they plac’d
them in a Coffin, on a Bier, Bed, or Couch of State,
and so convey’d them to the Sepulchre on their Shoulders.
This Duty was generally perform’d by the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Heir or nearest Relations, and sometimes the Magistrates,
Senators or chief of the Nobility bore the
Bodies of those who had deserv’d highly of the Common-Wealth,
of which see several Examples in <cite>Quenstedt</cite>,
p. 114. but Persons of meaner Rank, nay, and
sometimes even Great Men, that had been hated by
the People, were carry’d forth to their Burial by the
<i>Vespillones</i> or <i>Sandapilarii</i>, that is, the Sextons or common
Bearers, who liv’d by that Employ, and in this
last way of bearing out the Dead, we may suppose
them to have us’d the <i>Sandapila</i> or common Bier, as
the others did the <i>Lecticæ</i> or <i>Lecti</i>, that is, the Litters
or Beds; for the <i>Romans</i> us’d two sorts of Biers, the
one call’d <i>Lectica</i>, which was for the Rich, and the
other <i>Sandapila</i>, for the Poor. We read of this Bed
in the carrying forth of <i>Abner</i>, 2 <i>Sam.</i> 3. 31. where the
Translation is, that <i>King David himself follow’d the Bier</i>,
which word in <i>Hebrew</i> signifies a Bed. How this was
wont to be perfum’d with Spices and deck’d with precious
Flowers has been intimated before, as also how
the Corps was Dress’d, Crown’d and expos’d to public
View; but here we will take notice of the Pride and
Vanity of the <i>Romans</i>, who were accustom’d to Paint
or put a beautifying Wash on such whose Faces were
deform’d, that they might thereby appear handsomer
while Dead than Living, which Custom is said to be
us’d even in <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i> at this Day; but in case
the Visage were very much distorted by its Change,
bruis’d by the fall of an House, maim’d by any other
Accident, or the like, so that it was not fit to be seen,
then were they wont to throw a Covering or Pall over it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Persons</i> at the <i>Funeral</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The Persons present at Funerals were the Dead
Man’s Friends and Relations, who thought themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>under an Obligation to pay this last Respect to their
deceas’d Parent or Friend, who commonly had Legacies
left in his Will, that they might appear in decent
Mourning, and accompany the Corps with greater
Solemnity: Besides these, others were frequently invited
to encrease the Funeral-Procession, but this only
where the Laws did not restrain such Pomp as they
sometimes did in some Places, either to prevent the
Disorders that often happen’d at such promiscuous
Meetings, or to moderate the excessive Charges of
Funerals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Mourning-Habit</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The Habit these Persons wore was not always the
same, for tho’ they sometimes put on Mourning, and,
in common Funerals, retain’d their ordinary Apparel,
yet were the Exequies of Great Men commonly celebrated
among the <i>Pagans</i>, with expressions of Joy for
the reception of the Dead into Heaven. The Herse
was follow’d by abundance of Men and Women
cloath’d in white Garments, and bedeck’d with Garlands,
as is usual in Festival-Solemnities. The Funeral
was solemniz’d with <i>Pæans</i>, or Songs of Triumph, and
Dances: This Custom was in use among the <i>Greeks</i>.
The <i>Chineses</i>, <i>Syracusans</i> and <i>Argives</i> mourn’d in white,
as did also the antient <i>Romans</i>; but after their Empire
was settl’d they us’d black. The <i>Hebrews</i>, &amp;c. mourn’d
in black; the <i>Carthaginians</i> hung their Walls with
black, whence at this Day, to show the greater demonstration
of Grief, Palaces of Emperors, Kings and
Princes, as likewise Churches and Houses of private
Persons, are upon like occasions us’d to be hung with
black, which Custom was anciently practis’d by many
Nations, by reason this Colour was accounted the
most agreeable to Mourning and Sorrow.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Funeral <i>Procession</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Next we shall speak of the Funeral <i>Procession</i>, and of
such Persons as went before and usually follow’d the
Funeral-Bed: When the Herald had marshall’d all in
good Order, the Procession began to move, and we
are to take notice it was often made on Horseback or
in Coaches; but at the Funerals of Persons, to whom
a more than ordinary Respect was due, all went on
Foot: First march’d the Musicians with Trumpets,
Flutes, Cornets, Pipes and other Musical-Instruments,
sounding most sorrowful and mournful Notes; next
came the <i>Præficæ</i> or Women hir’d to mourn and sing
doleful Songs in Praise of the Deceas’d: These us’d
strange Shriekings and Gesticulations, beating their
Breasts, tearing their Hair and the like, so that by
their false Tears and feign’d Sorrow, they mov’d others
to cry in good earnest. These foolish Songs
and ridiculous Incantations <i>Justinian</i> the Emperor prohibited,
introducing in their room Psalms and Hymns,
which among the <i>Christians</i> continue to be sung before
the Corps even at this Day, and that to cherish
their Hearts and allay their Grief. If the Deceas’d
had been eminent for his Warlike Atchievements, then
the Arms, Standards and other Trophies taken by him
were usually carry’d before him. Next follow’d the
Priests and Religious Orders, tho’ the ordinary way
was for the Body to go first and the rest to follow,
whereby the Survivors were put in mind of their Mortality,
and warn’d to remember they were all to go
the same way the Deceas’d had gone before them: Then
immediately after the Corps came the Relations or
true Mourners, apparell’d in proper Habits, and the
Women with their Hair dishevell’d and their Faces
cover’d with Veils; the rest follow’d at some distance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and the Funeral-Pomp was clos’d up by the common
People.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manner of <i>Mourning</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>But to speak somewhat of the antient Manner of
<i>Mourning</i>, you must know that was various according
to the several Customs of Countries, yet this may be
laid down as a general Rule amongst most Nations,
that the better to express their Sorrow for the loss of a
deceas’d Relation or Friend, they on occasion of his
Death differ’d as much as could be from their ordinary
Habit and Behaviour. Hence Mourners in some
Cities demean’d themselves after the same manner that
in other Countries express’d Joy, and what was esteem’d
Rejoycing in some was in others a token of Sorrow:
For Example, in some Places it was customary to wear
short Hair, where long was a token of Mourning, but
in others, where long Hair was in Fashion, Mourners
were accustom’d to shave themselves. The most usual
ways, whereby the Ancients express’d their Sorrow,
was by refraining from Musick, Banquets and Entertainments,
from Garlands or Crowning themselves,
from Wine and strong Drink, and in a Word, from
every thing that occasion’d Mirth, or look’d Gay and
Pleasant: Such things were not judg’d fitting to be
admitted into so melancholly a Society as that of
Mourners, to whom even the Light was to be odious,
and nothing desirable but Darkness and lonesom Retirements.
These they thought best suited with their
Misfortunes, and therefore sequester’d themselves from
all Company and publick Solemnities, nay even refrain’d
from the very Comforts and Conveniences of
Life. They usually confin’d themselves within Doors,
and abstain’d from all Luxury, Ointments, Baths, Venery,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and on the contrary fasted and put on black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Habits, differing not only in Colour from their ordinary
Apparel, but also in Value, being only of a course
and cheap Stuff. They sprinkl’d Dust on their Heads,
nay, rowl’d in the very Dirt, thinking they shew’d the
greater Sorrow and Dejection by how much they were
the more dirty and nasty. These Customs were likewise
practis’d in the <i>East</i>, whence we find so frequent
mention of Penitents lying on the Ground, and putting
on Sackcloth and Ashes:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>With Sackcloth
and Ashes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They were so far from
wearing good Apparel, that they frequently burn’d
their richest Goods and Cloaths, and rent and tore
what they had off their Backs, on the first news of
any great Calamity: Thus <i>Reuben</i> did, <i>Gen.</i> 37. 29,
and Verse 34. <i>Jacob rent his Cloaths, and put Sackcloth
on his Loins, and mourn’d for his Son many Days.</i>
So in the 2 <cite>Samuel</cite> 3. 31. <i>David</i> commanded his Servants
to mourn for <i>Abner</i>; and thus also mourn’d
<i>Hezekiah</i>, 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 19. 1. See also <i>Nehem.</i> 9. 1. <i>Esther</i>,
4. 1. and <i>Lamentations</i> 2. 10.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cutting and tearing their Flesh.</div>

<p class='c009'>They also on such occasions shav’d off their Hair,
beat their Breasts, cut their Flesh, and with their Nails
tore holes in their Faces, that they might appear the
more deform’d and discontented. These frantick Actions,
tho’ practis’d sometimes by Men, were more frequent
among Women, whose Passions were more violent
and ungovernable; they wore their Hair long, dishevel’d
and carelessly flowing about, contrary to the
usage of the Men who shav’d theirs. The <i>Heathens</i>
were so superstitious in these Ceremonies, that they
extended the Practice of them to a higher degree than
the <i>Jews</i>, for they hir’d feign’d Mourners to make
frightful Howlings and sad Lamentations for the Dead,
and were wont to cause even their Horses, Mules, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to share in their Sorrows, by shaving their Manes, and
the like. These cruel and ridiculous Ceremonies were
restrain’d by Laws made on purpose, to restrain such
Excesses in Funerals;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Moderate
<i>Weeping</i> commendable.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
nevertheless a moderate Sorrow
and Mourning was never disallow’d, but on the contrary
commended and promis’d as a Blessing to the
Godly, and the want thereof threaten’d as a Malediction
or Curse, <cite>Isaiah</cite> 57. 1. <i>To mourn at the Interment
of our Friends</i> (says <cite>Weever</cite>, p. 16.) <i>is a manifest
Token of our true Love</i>: By it we express that natural
Affection we had to the departed Person, but this
ought always to be with a Christian moderation,
whereby our Faith towards <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> is demonstrated.
He gave us natural Affections, and commanded us to
love one another, and is not pleas’d such Love should
end with our Friends Life, but rather that we should
retain all due Respect to his Memory. <i>Antonio de
Guevara</i> in his 10th Letter, English’d by Mr. <i>Savage</i>,
says, <i>The Heart of Man is tender, and not able to part
with any Thing it loves without Concern</i>. This daily
Experience teaches us even in Brutes, who will in like
manner mourn for the Absence or Death of their
Companions or Young; for this Reason our Author
thus Expostulates, <i>Why should we not</i>, says he, <i>be allow’d
to shed Tears and lament over the Graves of our Friends,
since we are of a superiour Nature to Beasts?</i> Some account
Weeping a weakness and effeminacy, but there
are sufficient Examples to prove the contrary,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Us’d by Kings and Patriarchs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for if
such great and wise Men as Kings and Patriarchs
wept, surely a moderate Mourning for the Dead is
justifiable and pious; nay, the Holy Scripture shews
how those devout Men were commended who made
great Lamentations over <i>Stephen</i>’s Burial. We read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in the Old Testament how <i>Abraham</i> mourn’d and
wept for his Wife <i>Sarah</i>, Gen. 23. 2. and in <i>Chap.</i> 50.
<i>ver.</i> 1, 10, 17. we find <i>Joseph</i> wept over his dead Father
<i>Jacob</i>, and mourn’d for him: So King <i>David</i> follow’d
the Bier of <i>Abner</i> weeping, and when he came
to the Grave, both he and all the People wept, 2
<i>Sam.</i> 3. 31, 32. At another Time, when he heard the
News of his Sons being slain, <i>He arose and tore his
Garments and lay on the Earth, and all his Servants
stood by with their Cloaths rent</i>, 2 Sam. 13. 31. likewise
Verse 33, 36. when it was told that <i>only Amnon was
dead, The King’s Sons lift up their Voices and wept,
and the King also, and all his Servants wept very sore</i>.
At another Time he made great Lamentation for his
Son <i>Absalom</i>, 2 <i>Sam.</i> 18. 3. nevertheless he did not
allow of immoderate Grief and Mourning, but reprov’d
it himself, as you may read, 2 <i>Sam.</i> 12. 23. and
this because it was vain to do so, and could never recover
the Dead; so that when he bewail’d the Death
of <i>Saul</i> and <i>Jonathan</i>, of <i>Abner</i> and <i>Absalom</i>, it was
out of Love to them, and by reason the Common-Wealth
had a loss by some of their Deaths, and because
others of them died in their Sins. These may
be sufficient Reasons moderately to mourn for the
Dead; but we read of several other good Men who
wept on other Occasions, as the <i>Man of God</i>, 2 <cite>Kings</cite>
8. 11. <i>Hezekiah</i>, 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 20. 3. <i>Nehemiah</i> 1. 4. and
Christ himself,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>By our <i>Saviour</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who was never known to laugh, is recorded
to have wept twice, once over the foreseen
Desolation of <i>Jerusalem</i>, Luke 19. 41. and another
Time over the Grave of <i>Lazarus</i>, John 11. 35. from
which last, the <i>Jews</i> collected his Love towards the
Dead: Now as Weeping on the Death of a Friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>expresses our Grief for the Loss of him, and is done
out of Respect and Love to him, so does it likewise
moderate our Passion and allay our Concern,

As for the other Uses of Weeping, see <i>Santorellus</i> in
his <cite>Post-Praxis Medica</cite>, p. 30. who writes Philosophically
of its Nature and Cause.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Following</i> the <i>Corps</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Besides these Mourners and Relations there follow’d
a great number of Friends and Acquaintance to the
Place of Burial; for it was not only look’d on as a
Duty, but a religious Friendship to attend a Corps to
its Grave. Thus we read, <i>Joseph went up to Bury his
Father, and with him all the Servants of Pharaoh, the
Elders of his House, and all the Elders of Egypt</i>, Gen.
50. 7. and this even from the Land of <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Canaan</i>.
So King <i>David</i> and all his Servants follow’d
the Bier of <i>Abner</i>, 2 Sam. 3. 31. and we read in <i>Luke</i>
7. 12. that much People of the City of <i>Naim</i> follow’d
the Widow’s Son.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Corps being brought forth to the Place of Burial,
after the manner already describ’d, within or
without the City,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Act</i> of <i>Burial</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the next Thing was the <i>Act</i> of <i>Burial</i>.
This has been perform’d various ways, but the
two most common, were either <i>Burying</i> or <i>Burning</i>,
whether of which be the most eligible we shall next
enquire into. Burial is the more antient, as having
been us’d in the Primitive Ages by the <i>Hebrews</i>, <i>Greeks</i>,
<i>Romans</i>, and most other Nations, yet the two latter
<i>burn’d</i> their Dead, as is pretended on the following
Considerations. <i>First</i>, That Worms and such like
vile Insects might be thereby prevented from corroding
the noble Bodies of the Dead, and the Living be
freed from the Infection and Stench of Carcasses rotting
in the Earth. <i>Secondly</i>, Because Fire purefy’d
the Dead, and was the quickest way of Incineration,
or reducing Bodies to their first Elements, whereby
the Soul being set at Liberty, might take its Flight to
the Heavenly Mansions. <i>Thirdly</i>, Being so immediately
reduc’d to Ashes, it could not be easily inform’d
and mov’d about by the Devil, to the great Terror
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and Amazement of all People. And, <i>Lastly</i>, they likewise
thought it secur’d them from the Exultation of
the Enemy, in exposing and abusing their Corps,
which last I take to be the true Occasion of Burning
their Dead: For as <i>Pliny</i> says, <i>Lib.</i> 7. <i>cap.</i> 54. <i>Sylla</i>
having dug up the Body of <i>Caius Marius</i>, his mortal
Enemy, and fearing the like Fate, engag’d the People
by an express Law, that they should for the future
burn both him and others after they were dead, and
this tho’ none of the <i>Cornelii</i> his Predecessors had ever
been burn’d. From hence it was the <i>Romans</i> brought
in the Custom of <i>Burning</i> their Dead, which was perform’d
after the following manner:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Burning</i> the <i>Dead</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Having erected a <i>Pile</i> in form of an Altar, made
either of ordinary Wood, such as Oak, Ash, Olive, Pine,
Fir, and the like resiniferous Trees, which caus’d it
easily to catch Fire, or else of odoriferous, such as Cedar,
Cypress, Mirtle, <i>&amp;c.</i> They plac’d the Corps with
the Couch thereon, and then set round about the
Arms, Sword, Belt or Spoils taken in War of the Deceas’d,
his best Houshold-Goods and richest Apparel,
his finest Horses, Dogs or the like, and in the more
barbarous Ages his Slaves, all which, having first slain
the Beasts, <i>&amp;c.</i> they burn’d together with him. In
some Places the Wives flung themselves alive into the
Pile, and were burn’d with their Husbands, and commonly
all such Things as the Deceas’d most valu’d
while they liv’d, besides abundance of rich Presents
brought by Relations and Friends, all sorts of Perfumes
and sweet Odours, such as Cinamon, Cassia,
Frankinsence, <i>&amp;c.</i> and odoriferous Oils and Ointments
were burn’d with them, as we read the <i>Israelites</i> us’d
to do at the Burials of their Kings, as they did at that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of <i>Asa</i>, 2 <cite>Chron.</cite> 16. 14. and other Places. When the
Pile was burn’d down, the nearest Relations gather’d
up the Ashes and Bones,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ossilegium.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and having wash’d them with
Wine, Milk or Water, put them into Urns made of
different kinds of Matter, such as Gold, Silver, Brass,
Marble, Glass, Earthen-Ware, Cedar, and the like;
then they pour’d out Tears upon them, which being
catch’d in small Vessels call’d <i>Lacrymatoriæ</i>, were reposited
with the Urn in a Tomb.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Funeral <i>Oration</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>An Oration or Funeral-Sermon was likewise solemnly
pronounc’d in Praise of the Deceas’d, by a Person
appointed for that purpose by the public Magistrate.
When the Funeral was over, other Ceremonies were
perform’d in Honour of the Dead as Festivals, which
may be reduc’d to these three Heads, <i>Sacrifices</i>, <i>Feasts</i>
and <i>Games</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sacrifices.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Sacrifices</i> consisted of Liquors, Victims and
Garlands; the Liquors were Wine, Milk, Water,
Blood, Honey and liquid Balsam.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Feasts.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Feasts</i> were either Publick or Private: The
Private were kept about the Tomb of the Deceas’d by
the nearest Relations and Friends only, being prepar’d
both for the Dead and Living. The Repast design’d
for the Dead consisting commonly of Beans, Lettices,
Bread and Eggs, or the like, was laid on the Tomb
for the Deceas’d to come out and Eat, as they fancy’d
he would. The Public Feasts were when the Heirs
or Friends of some Rich or Great Dead Person oblig’d
the People with a general Treat to his Honour and
Memory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Games.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The Funeral <i>Games</i> consisted of a great number of
Gladiators, fighting with Beasts, <i>&amp;c.</i> the Ancients
thinking the Dead delighted in such bloody Sacrifices;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>but this Barbarous Custom of burning the Dead continu’d
no longer than the Time of the <i>Antonines</i>, who
being virtuous Princes abhorr’d such Cruelties, and
therefore brought Burial again into Practice. Thus
it plainly appears, Burial was not only more antient
but more eligible than Burning, since one was admitted
upon Choice and the other by Compulsion; for
so soon as such cruel minded Persons were remov’d,
Burial was again introduc’d: Besides, as it appears by
Holy Writ and the Canon-Law, Burning was a most
ignominious way of dealing with the Dead, to which
none were expos’d but such as had lain with Beasts or
their own Sex; and we at this Day only burn Female-Traitors,
or such as have kill’d their Husbands, <i>&amp;c.</i>
thereby to show the Heinousness of their Crime; on
the contrary, Sepulture was always esteem’d Honourable
among <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s People. Thus the Patriarchs
<i>Abraham</i>, <i>Isaac</i>, <i>Jacob</i> and <i>Joseph</i>, as also <i>Moses</i> were
bury’d, and the last particularly by <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> himself,
<cite>Deut.</cite> 34. 7. Likewise the Holy Fathers, St. <i>Austin</i>, St.
<i>Ambrose</i>, St. <i>Gregory</i>, and most of the <i>Primitive Christians</i>
were for having their Bodies bury’d and not
burn’d:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Situation</i> of
the <i>Dead</i> in
their <i>Sepulchres</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But as for the manner of Burying or placing
them in their Sepulchres, that was various, according
to the different Opinions or Customs of several Nations,
a few of which we shall here relate. The <i>Egyptians</i>
set dead Bodies on their Feet, as <i>Solinus</i> observes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The <i>Egyptians</i>, when the Funeral-Pomp was made,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shut up in odorous Tombs the standing Dead.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The <i>Phænicians</i> bury’d the Dead on their Backs, yet
turn’d them to the West, in Imitation of the Setting-Sun,
as the <i>Athenians</i> did to the East in regard of its
Rising. The <i>Nasamones</i>, a People of <i>Africa</i>, did not
only for the greatest part die sitting, but also bury’d
their Dead in that Posture, and the Inhabitants of <i>Megara</i>
plac’d their Dead with their Faces downwards:
So <i>Diogenes</i> desir’d to be bury’d, his Reason being, that
as he believ’d the World would at last be turn’d topsie-turvy,
he then should lye upright: Yet the general
way was to lye with the Face upwards towards the
Fountain of Life, and Abodes of the Celestial Gods,
and to be so situated in the Grave, as to see the Rising-Sun.
As for the <i>Christians</i>, they bury’d their Dead supine,
as looking towards Heaven, where their sole
Hopes were plac’d, and towards the East as waiting
for the Resurrection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next let us consider the Places where the Ancients
us’d to bury their Dead, and how they dug their
Graves, and erected their Sepulchres and Monuments.
In order to this you must know, <i>First</i>, That Sepulchres
were not always of a kind, nor might all People
be bury’d in the same Place of Sepulture, but proper
ones were invented for different Degrees and Ranks,
so that some were Public and some Private; some
common or belonging to all, and others peculiar to
one Family, and these again either built by the Persons
whilst alive, or order’d by their Wills how they would
have them erected after their Deaths.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Monuments</i> Built during Life.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus <i>Absalom</i>
in his Life-Time erected a Pillar to preserve his Memory
in case his Issue-Male fail’d, 2 <i>Sam.</i> 18. 18. which
Pillar, hewn out of a Rock or Quarry, he intended
for his Sepulchre, and which, according to <i>Sandys</i>, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to be seen at this Day. <i>Augustus Cæsar</i>, in the 6th Year
of his Consulship, built a Funeral-Monument for himself
and Successors; but that Mausoleum, as <i>Xiphilinus</i>
writes, being full in the Time of <i>Adrian</i>, that Emperor
rais’d himself a Tomb or Sepulchre near the <i>Pons
Ælius</i>. Nay it was usual for such as were careful of
their Burials, to provide their own Tombs in their
Lives Time, and this for their better Satisfactions, with
these or the like Inscriptions:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>VIVUS FECIT. VIVUS SIBI POSUIT.</div>
      <div class='line'>VIVUS FACIENDUM CURAVIT.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>For the same Reason King <i>Henry</i> the Seventh built a
fair and glorious Chapel at <i>Westminster</i> as an House of
Burial for himself, his Children, and such only of the
Blood-Royal as should descend from his Loins, forbidding
all others of what Degree or Quality soever to be
interr’d in that sacred Mould, as appears by his last
Will and Testament, <cite>Weever</cite> p. 20. Now, as for such
as did not build their Monuments themselves, but only
order’d them by their last Wills, it was held such
Wills could not be violated with a safe Conscience,
nor might any one change, alienate or detract from
them; for since Monuments were invented as well to
preserve Mens Memories as their Bodies, it would be
very hard and inhuman to deprive them of them,
yet has there been such base Heirs, as appears by the
Inscriptions of some Tombs, which give the Reader
a Caution therein, whereof I have inserted two.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That some Persons were better pleas’d to build their
Tombs themselves, we read in 2 <cite>Chron.</cite> 16. 14. how
<i>King Asa was bury’d in his own Sepulchre, which he had
made for himself in the City of David</i>: And how <i>Shebnah</i>
had taken care to have a Sepulchre hew’d for himself
in <i>Jerusalem</i>. The same is also said of <i>Joseph</i> of
<i>Arimathæa</i>, Matth. 27. 60.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Places</i> of <i>Sepulture</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Places of Sepulture were
of two kinds, Public and Private. The Public were
likewise of two sorts, <i>viz.</i> Such as were allotted the
Poor, and others that were us’d only by the Rich:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puticulæ</span></i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The poor Servants, and such like mean Persons, were
bury’d in Ditches or Graves call’d <i>Puticulæ</i> or <i>Puticuli</i>,
and so nam’d, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A Puteis fossis, vel quod Corpora ibi
putrescerent</span></i>. These were Holes in the Earth made like
to Wells, between Mount <i>Esquiline</i>, the Walls of the
City, and the Street which leads to the Gate <i>Querquetulana</i>;
but these Wells infecting all the neighbouring
parts of the City, <i>Augustus</i> for removing thereof, gave
that Place to <i>Mæcenas</i>, who built a stately House, and
made very fine Gardens there, as his Favourite <i>Horace</i>
informs us. There were other public Places, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>those that had deserv’d well of the Common-Wealth
had their Monuments, which were chiefly allow’d them
as a Reward of their Virtues. As for the <i>Roman</i> Kings
they were bury’d in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campus Martius</span></i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campus Martius.</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
where the
<i>Mausolæum</i> of <i>Augustus</i> stood, together with a vast
number of antient Sepulchres and Monuments all along
the River side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Private.</div>

<p class='c009'>Private Burying-Places were such as any one had in
his own House, Garden or Fields: Thus we read <cite>Samuel</cite>
was bury’d in his House at <i>Ramah</i>, Sam. 25. 1.
and <i>Joab</i> in his House in the Wilderness, 1 <cite>Kings</cite> 2.
34. The antient <i>Grecians</i> were also bury’d in Places
prepar’d for that purpose in their own Houses; and
the <i>Thebans</i> had once a Law, that no Person should
build a House without providing in it a Repository for
the Dead; but this Custom was afterwards forbidden,
as appears by that Passage in <i>Isiodorus</i>, Lib. 14. <cite>Orig.</cite>
cap. 11. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prius autem quisq; in Domo sua sepeliebatur,
postea vetitum est Legibus, ne fætore ipso Corpora Viventium
contactu inficerentur</span></i>.<a id='t89'></a> <i>At first every one was bury’d
in his own House, but afterwards it was forbidden by the
Laws, lest the Living might thereby be infected.</i> <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tolosanus
in Syntagm. Juris universal</span></cite>, Lib. 33. cap. 23. gives
another Reason, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne Licentia illa Sepeliendi familiares
daret delinquendi &amp; occisos occultandi Occasionem</span></i>. <i>Lest
such a Liberty of Burying the Family, should give occasion
of committing Murder and afterwards hiding it.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>In <i>Gardens</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes the Ancients bury’d in their Gardens, as
we read <i>Manasseth was interr’d in the Garden of his own
House, in the Garden of Uzza</i>, 2 Kings 21. 18. and
<i>Tacitus</i> tells us <i>Galba</i>’s Body was bury’d by <i>Argius</i> his
Steward, with little or no Ceremony, in his private
Garden. We read also of a Sepulchre in the Garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>made by <i>Joseph</i> of <i>Arimathæa</i> to lay our Saviour’s Body
in, <cite>John</cite> 19. 41.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In Fields.</div>

<p class='c009'>They likewise bury’d in Fields, and so the <i>Patriarchs</i>
were said to be bury’d in a Cave in the Field of <i>Machpelah</i>,
Gen. 23. 20. also ’tis related that <i>Uzziah</i> King
of <i>Judah</i> <i>slept with his Fathers, and was bury’d with them
in the Field of Burial which pertain’d to the Kings</i>, 2
Chron. 26. 23. Tho’ they term’d these two last Private,
because they bury’d in Fields and Gardens belonging
only to their own Families, yet, if it was possible,
they always interr’d their Dead in that part of
the Garden or Field which lay nearest the common
Road or Highway, thereby to put Passengers in mind
of their Mortality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In Highways.</div>

<p class='c009'>For this Reason they more frequently bury’d in
the Highways and public Roads, that by seeing the
Monuments of the Dead the Memory of them might
not only be excited, but also the Living be encourag’d
to imitate the Virtues of such Great Men as were represented
on those stately Tombs, and likewise to admonish
them, that what they were they should also be.
This plainly appears by the Epitaphs and Inscriptions
which always spoke to the Traveller after this manner:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em class='gesperrt'>SISTE VIATOR. ASPICE VIATOR. CAVE VIATOR</em>, and the like.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>In Mountains and Hills.</div>

<p class='c009'>The Ancients likewise bury’d in Mountains and
Hills. <i>Joshua</i>, Captain of the <i>Hebrews</i>, and <i>Eleazar</i>,
Son of <i>Aaron</i>, were both bury’d in Mount <i>Ephraim</i>,
<i>Joshua</i> 24. 30, 33. <i>Judges</i> 2. 9. and we read in 2 <cite>Kings</cite>
23. 16. that <i>as Josiah turn’d himself, he spy’d the Sepulchres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that were in the Mountain</i>. Likewise the <i>Grecians</i>
and <i>Romans</i> bury’d their Kings and Great Men either
on the tops of Mountains, or at their feet, as <i>Isiodorus</i>,
Lib. 15. <cite>Etimolog.</cite> cap. 11. observes. Thus <i>Aventinus
Sylvius</i>, King of the <i>Albans</i>, was interr’d in the Hill
that receiv’d its Name from him, as <i>Titus Livius</i> and
<i>Aurelius de Orig. Gent. Roman.</i> testifie. <i>Virgil</i> reports
the same thing of King <i>Dercennus</i>, Æn. 11. v. 850.</p>

<p class='c009'>So also <i>Weever</i> in his Funeral-Monuments, <i>p.</i> 6. observes,
they were antiently wont to bury here in <i>England</i>
either on ridges of Hills, or on spacious Plains fortify’d
or fenc’d about with Obelisks, pointed Stones, Pyramids,
Pillars, or such like Monuments. For Example,
<i>England</i>’s Wonder on <i>Salisbury-Plain</i> call’d <i>Stonehenge</i>,
the Sepulchre of so many <i>Britains</i>, who, by the Treachery
of the <i>Saxons</i>, were slain there at a Parley:
That of <i>Wada</i> the <i>Saxon</i> Duke near <i>Whitby</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>,
and those of <i>Cartigerne</i> the <i>Britain</i>, and <i>Horsa</i> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><i>Saxon</i> near <i>Ailesford</i> in <i>Kent</i>. It was a thing usual
among our <i>Saxon</i> Ancestors (says <i>Verstegan</i>) as by
<i>Tacitus</i> it also seems to have been among the other
<i>Germans</i>, that the dead Bodies of such as were slain
in the Field, and bury’d there, were not laid in Graves,
but lying on the Ground were cover’d over with
Turfs or Clods of Earth,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>In Plains cover’d with Turfs, <i>&amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and the more Reputation
they had had, the greater and higher were the Turfs
rais’d over them. This some us’d to term <i>Byriging</i>,
others <i>Beorging</i>, and some <i>Buriging</i>, which we now
call <i>Berying</i> or <i>Burying</i>, which is properly a shrouding
or hiding the dead Body in the Earth. Of these kinds
of Funeral-Monuments you have many on <i>Salisbury-Plain</i>,
out of which the Bones of Bodies thus inhum’d
have oftentimes been dug. These Places the Inhabitants
thereabouts call <i>Beries</i>, <i>Baroes</i> or <i>Burroughs</i>, which
agrees with the words <i>Byrighs</i>, <i>Beorghs</i> or <i>Burghs</i> spoken
in the same Sence. From hence the Names of divers
Towns and Cities were originally deriv’d; Places first
so call’d having been with Walls of Turf or Clods of
Earth, fenc’d about for Men to shroud themselves in,
as in Forts or Castles: Thus far <i>Weever</i>. We shall
next take notice that the <i>Romans</i> antiently made their
Graves of Turf, which they call’d <i>Injectio Glebæ</i>, and
for the same Reason the Latin word <i>Tumulus</i>, which
in its proper Sense imports no more than a Hillock,
came afterwards to signifie a Grave or Tomb. These
were compos’d of two parts, one the Grave or Tomb,
and the other the Ground surrounding them, fenc’d
about with Pales, Walls, or the like. Here we may
observe that most of the Ancients Burials were without
their Town and Cities, either for fear the Air
might be corrupted thro the stench of Putrefy’d Bodies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>or the Buildings endanger’d by the frequency of
Funeral-Fires; wherefore they made choice of more
convenient Places for their Interments in the Suburbs
or Country, such as Mountains, Hills, Woods, Fields
or Highways, which were barren Places; for as
<i>Plato</i>, Lib. 12. <cite>De Leg.</cite> says, No Sepulchre was to be
made in a fertile Soil or fruitful Field, but that Place
was only to be us’d which was steril and good for nothing
else.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now tho’ it was forbidden both by the <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Roman</i> Laws,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Burial</i> in the <i>City</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to bury within the Walls of Cities, yet
was there nevertheless a Reserve made for some particular
Persons, such as Emperors, Vestal-Virgins, and those
that had merited Favour by some extraordinary Action
or Virtue. It seem’d likewise an Honour due to
Lawyers, that they who had kept the Citizens in a
healthful Concord whilst alive, might when dead
remain in the midst of them. Likewise we often read
of Monuments erected in the <i>Forum</i> or middle of the
City, but that we must look on as a Favour chiefly bestow’d
on Men of Worth, and public Benefactors;
nay, sometimes Persons of a more than ordinary Desert
and Excellency were permitted to be bury’d in
the Temples of the Gods;  and some are of Opinion,
such Honours paid the Dead were the first Causes of
erecting Temples; see <cite>Arnobius</cite>, Lib. 6. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">advers. Gentes</span></i>,
and <i>Isiodorus</i>, Lib. 15. <cite>Origin.</cite> cap. 11. Nor are later
Times wholly destitute of such Examples. We read
moreover in the Holy Scripture, that Persons of eminent
Ranks and Quality were bury’d in the City. So
<i>David</i> was bury’d in the City call’d after his own
Name, where also <i>Solomon</i>, <i>Abijam</i>, <i>Asa</i>, <i>Jehosaphat</i>,
<i>Joram</i>, <i>Ahaziab</i>, <i>Jehoash</i>, <i>Amaziah</i>, <i>Azariah</i>, <i>Jothan</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><i>Ahaz</i>, <i>Rehoboam</i>, <i>Jehoiada</i> and <i>Joash</i> were bury’d, 1
<cite>Kings</cite> 2. 10. 11. 43. 15. 8, 24. 22. 50. 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 8. 24.
9. 28. 12. 21. 14. 20. 15. 7, 38. 16. 20. 2 <cite>Chron.</cite> 12.
16. 16. 14. 24. 16, 25. 27. 9. <i>Ahab</i>, <i>Jehu</i>, <i>Jehoahaz</i>,
and the Kings of <i>Israel</i> were interr’d in the City of
<i>Samaria</i>, and <i>Amaziah</i> in the City of <i>Judah</i>, 1 <cite>Kings</cite>
22. 27. 2 <cite>Kings</cite> 10. 35. 13. 9. 14. 16. 2 <cite>Chron.</cite> 25.
28. with abundance of other Instances, too many to
be related here: Besides it has long been the Custom
of most modern Nations to bury in their Cities and
Churches their Kings, Princes, Nobles, Gentry, Poets,
and Men of the greatest Parts and Merit. The Emperors
and Arch-Dukes of <i>Austria</i> are bury’d at <i>Vienna</i>,
the Kings of <i>England</i> in <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>, the Kings of
<i>France</i> in the Monastery of St. <i>Dennis</i>, the Kings of
<i>Sueden</i> at <i>Stockholm</i>, the Kings of <i>Poland</i> at <i>Cracow</i>,
the Electors of <i>Saxony</i> at <i>Fridberg</i>, the Counts Palatine
of the <i>Rhine</i> at <i>Heydelberg</i>, and the like, whereof see
more Examples in <cite>Quenstedt</cite>, p. 205. and <cite>Weever</cite>, p. 8.
but more especially in <i>Panvinus de Rit. Sepeliendi</i>, who
gives a whole Catalogue of such Kings, Princes and
Priests as have been bury’d in Churches. But to proceed
to speak of the Nature and Distinction of such
Places of Sepulture as the Ancients us’d, whether
within or without the City, they were distinguish’d
into <i>Proper</i> and <i>Common</i>, <i>Family</i> and <i>Hereditary Burial-Places</i>
or <i>Sepulchres</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Proper Sepulchres.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Proper Sepulchres</i> were such particular Places as any
one reserv’d for himself, where none had ever been
laid before, and from whence he could by his Will
exclude any of his Heirs. To this purpose they inscrib’d
on their Tombs these Letters: H. M. H. N. S.
that is, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc Monumentum Heredes non sequitur</span></i>. Or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>these, H. M. <i>ad</i> H. N. <em class='gesperrt'>TRANS.</em> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc Monumentum
ad Heredes non transit.</span></i> Which Inscriptions are still to
be met with in abundance of Places, and shew the
Heir has no Right or Claim to Burial there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Common Sepulchres.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Common Sepulchres</i> were such as the <i>Puticulæ</i> for the
poorer Sort, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campus Martius</span></i> for Men of Quality,
Honour or Merit, the <i>Ceramnicus</i> for such as were
slain in War, and other the like Places to bury Strangers
in, call’d <i>Poluandria</i>. So we read the chief Priests
of the <i>Jews</i> bought the Potters Field for this Purpose,
with Thirty pieces of Silver, which <i>Judas</i> had taken
to betray Christ, <i>Matth.</i> 27. 7.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Family-Sepulchres.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Family-Sepulchres</i> were such as were only common
to Heirs and Posterity, who had a right to be bury’d
therein: Some again were only for the Husband and
Wife, having this Inscription, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sibi &amp; Conjugi</span></i>; others
for the Children likewise, inscrib’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sibi, Conjugi &amp;
Liberis</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hereditary-Sepulchres.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Hereditary-Sepulchres</i> were such as the <i>Testator</i> appointed
for himself and his Heirs, or acquir’d by Right
of Inheritance. These sometimes belong’d to the
whole Family, as to Children and Relations: Now
for the better understanding how these Sepulchres
were made, which were capable of holding such a
number of Persons, we must observe they were certain
Caves, Grots or Vaults dug under Ground, and
divided into several Partitions, in which each Body
being put up in a Coffin of Stone, Lead, Wood, <i>&amp;c.</i>
these Coffins were laid each in its own Apartment;
for such Burial-Places were wont to have as many Divisions
as they design’d Persons to be bury’d in them:
Thus some became unlimited, possessing several Miles
of Ground; such were the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cryptæ Kiovienses</span></i>, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><i>Herbinius</i> has wrote a Book of, and the Catacombs
of <i>Rome</i> and <i>Naples</i>, of which you have an exact
Account in <i>Bosio</i>’s <i>Roma Subterranea</i>, and Bishop <i>Burnet</i>’s
Travels. The <i>Greeks</i> call’d such a Burial-Place,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὙΠΌΓΕΙΟΝ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ τὴν γῆν</span>, <i>sub Terra</i>, <i>Hypogeum</i>, and the
<i>Latins</i> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crypta</span></i>, deriving the Word from the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρύπτη</span>, <i>a</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρύπτω</span><a id='t96'></a>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">abdo</span></i>; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia abdita est</span></i>. These serving
not only for Sepultures to the Primitive <i>Christians</i>, but
during the Time of Persecution, for hiding Places,
where they held Synods and administred the Sacraments,
as <i>Panvinus</i> in Lib. <cite>De Cæmiteriis</cite>, cap. 11 relates.
These Subterranean Caves were at first dug
only out of the Earth, but afterwards they were hew’d
out of solid Rocks, or else curiously wrought and
pay’d with Stone, being arch’d above, and adorn’d
with no less Art and Care than the Houses of the
Living; insomuch that it was customary to place
Lamps in these Subterranean-Vaults, whither such
Mourners as had a mind to express an extraordinary
Concern for the Deceas’d, retir’d, cloistering themselves
up for many Days and Nights, whereof we have
an Example in <i>Petronius</i>’s Story of the <i>Ephesian</i> Matron.
Thus the <i>Egyptians</i> and <i>Persians</i> bury’d in
Caves dug out of solid Rocks, or at the bottoms of
such stony Mountains, as <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> and other
Writers inform us. There was also at <i>Nismes</i> in
<i>Languedoc</i> a <i>Crypta</i> found, with a rich inlaid Pavement
and Niches round about the Wall, in each of which
gilded Glass-Urns full of Ashes were set in order.
The <i>Jews</i> likewise hew’d their Sepulchres out of Rocks,
into which they descended thro’ a narrow Passage,
which was shut up with a Stone, as appears by that of
<i>Lazarus</i>, John 11. 38. and that of <i>Joseph</i> of <i>Arimathæa</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>wherein our Saviour’s Body was laid, <i>Matth.</i> 27. 60.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cenotaphs.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>Thus far we have treated of Sepulchres properly so
call’d, now we will speak of such as were erected to
preserve the Memories of those that were bury’d else-where,
whence they came to be call’d <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΚΕΝΟΤΆΦΙΟΝ</span>,
<i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κενὸς τάφος</span><a id='t97'></a>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inanis Tumulus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tumulus sine Corpore</span></i>,
a Sepulchre rais’d in Honour of some Person, and
wherein his Body had never been laid. Of these there
were two sorts, one erected to such as had been honour’d
with Funeral-Rites in another <i>Place</i>, and the
other for those who had never obtain’d any. <i>First</i>,
They built these Sepulchres for Religions sake, by reason
they thought the Souls of those that had been depriv’d
of the Rites and Honours of Sepulture wander’d
about, and could never pass the <i>Stygian</i> Lake: See <i>page</i>
21. <i>Secondly</i>, They esteem’d it the next Felicity to
Sepulture to lye in their own Country, wherefore
when any one died in a forreign Land, they thrice
invok’d his Ghost or Soul, which thereby, as they
thought, speedily hastening to them, they erected a
Tomb or Monument for it. This without doubt afforded
no small Joy and Comfort, by reason they believ’d
in doing thus, their Bodies were driven under
Ground to their own Country, and the <i>Jews</i> even at
this Day believe, that immediately after their Deaths
their Souls pass into the Land of <i>Canaan</i>. <i>Nicolaius</i>,
Lib. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Luctu Græcorum</span></cite>, p. 17. It was also customary,
among the nearest Friends and Relations, to
build various Tombs for one and the same Person,
and that in various Places, which they did to do the
Deceas’d the more Honour, as <i>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</i>,
Lib. 1. <cite>Antiqu. Roman.</cite> observes. We may also gather
from <i>Prudentius</i>, Lib. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περί στεφάνων</span> that the <i>Christians</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>built <i>Cenotaphs</i> in Honour of their Martyrs, and <cite>Gretserius
de Funer. Christi</cite>, Lib. 3. cap. 6. says, they were
erected in Commemoration of the Deceas’d. Hence
may be likewise gather’d the Use and Benefit of Tombs,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Use and Benefit of <i>Tombs</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as <i>First</i>, That they were erected in Honour to the Deceas’d.
<i>Secondly</i>, Often Built at the public Cost, as a
Reward to Virtue and Valour. And, <i>Lastly</i>, they were
moreover thought to be a Comfort to the Living; for
as <i>Theodoric</i> gravely said, Bodies bury’d in Coffins and
Tombs were esteem’d no small Consolation to Mourners,
inasmuch as the Souls of the Deceas’d departed
only from the Conversation of the World, whereas
their Bodies did not for some time leave their surviving
Friends: If therefore such Things could afford
so great satisfaction to the Living, how much more
would it delight them to see the Bodies of their dead
Ancestors, with a long Lineage of their Family, so
perfect as to distinguish their Persons and Sex by the
preserv’d Features, and this without any offensive
Smell or deform’d Aspect, as we are well assur’d both
the <i>Egyptians</i> and the Inhabitants of <i>Teneriff</i> us’d to
do, which is not even impossible to perform at this
Day? The Ancients were so exceedingly carefull of
every particular Ceremony in Funeral-Rites, that they
made it the chief Point of their Religion to perform
them, as an indispensible Duty their Gods requir’d of
them, and their Laws strictly maintain’d; so that to
neglect them was the greatest Cruelty, and to violate
them a capital Crime and Sacriledge. They added
every thing to their Sepulchres that could make them
Sacred, Honourable and Respected, or which could
transmit their Names to Posterity, their Fame to Eternity,
and their Ashes to Perpetual Repose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How adorn’d and with what <i>Inscriptions</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Besides, they were wont to carve thereon the Arms,
Trophies, Coat-Armour and Effigies of the Deceas’d,
subjoining moreover such <i>Elogiums</i> and Inscriptions
as best express’d their Family, Virtues, Studies, Emploiments,
Works or noble Actions; their Condition of
Life, Age, Time and Cause of Death, and in a Word,
whatever else was Remarkable in them and worthy
Commemoration.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How call’d.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
These Structures for the Dead
were call’d after several Names, from the several Uses
they were put to when erected; for some contain’d
whole Bodies, others their Ashes only, and some neither
one nor the other, being only built to transmit the
Memory of the Party deceas’d to succeeding Ages,
whence they were call’d <i>Cenotaphs</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cenotaphs.</i> <i>Sepulchres.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Sepulchres</i> were
so nam’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a Sepeliendo</span></i>, which signifies <i>committing to the
Ground</i>, <i>laying up therein</i>, or <i>hiding</i> or <i>covering with
Earth</i>, whence <i>burying</i> came to be call’d <i>Sepulture</i>, and
<i>Burial-Places</i> <i>Sepulchres</i>. <i>Scipio Gentilis</i>, Lib. <i>Origin.
Sing.</i> says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monumentum quasi Munimentum dicitur, quod
Causa Muniendi ejus Loci factum est</span></i>. Monuments <i>were
sometimes very fitly call’d</i> Muniments,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Muniments.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>by reason they
fenc’d in and defended the Corps from being torn out of
its Grave by Savage Beasts</i>, and likewise preserv’d the
same from all farther Violation. They were call’d
<i>Tumuli</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tombs.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod coacervata ibi Terra tumeat</span></i>, because Turf
or Earth was wont to be heap’d over them, which the
higher it was the more Honourable; but these being
easily scratch’d up by <i>Hyena’s</i>, Wolves, and the like
voracious Animals, and because the Ancients bury’d
at first far out of Cities, in the Highways, Woods,
Hills and Mountains, thence says <i>Servius</i> on <cite>Æneid.</cite>
11. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Factum est aut Pyramides fierent, aut ingentes collocarentur

<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>over their Graves.</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Memories</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They were also call’d <i>Memories</i>,
<i>a Memoria</i>, and <i>Monuments</i>,

<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a monendo, quia monebant
Mentem</span></i>, because as St. <i>Austin</i> says, Lib. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Cura
pro Mortuis</span></cite>, we are by them put in Mind and warn’d
to consider our frail Condition, they being external
Helps to excite and stir up our inward Thoughts, to
have the remembrance of Death before our Eyes, that
our deceas’d Brethren may not be out of our Minds,
tho’ they are out of our sight. Much the same Etymology
of a Monument <i>Varro</i> gives, Lib. 5. <cite>De Lingua
Latina</cite>, and <i>Weever</i> of Funeral-Monuments, <i>p.</i> 9. has
collected such another out of a Manuscript in the

<i>in</i> London.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dormitories.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Christians</i> us’d to call Sepulchres <i>Dormitories</i> or
<i>Sleeping Places</i>, where the Bodies of the Faithful rested
in their Graves as in their Beds, <cite>vide</cite> p. 17. The <i>Pagans</i>
also gave them the like Synonymous<a id='t100'></a> Names, such as

<div class='sidenote'><i>Houses.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes they were call’d <i>Houses</i>, in that there is no
House so much and truly our own as our Grave,
whence <i>Job</i> rightly express’d himself, <i>Chap.</i> 30. <i>ver.</i> 23.
<i>I know thou wilt bring me to Death, and to the House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>appointed for all Men Living</i>. Likewise <i>Chap.</i> 4. 9. he
terms them <i>Houses of Clay</i>, but <cite>Isaiah</cite> Chap. 14. 18.
describes them more elegantly in these Words, <i>All the
Kings of the Nations lye in Glory, every one in his own
House</i>. Others gave them still more pompous Titles,
such as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus Æterna</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus Æternitatis</span></i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> for as
<i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib. 1. <cite>Bibl. Histor.</cite> relates, The <i>Egyptians</i>
accounted the Houses they liv’d in but as Inns,
by reason their stay was so short in them, whereas they
deem’d their Sepulchres more durable and eternal, and
this because they believ’d the Dead were always to
abide and continue in them, so that they took more
Care of, and were at far greater Charge about them
than their Houses: Also that these might be the more
lasting and permanent, the Ancients spared no Cost
nor Trouble, but with prodigious Labour and Expence
rais’d them out of Marble, Stone, Brass or the
like. The <i>Æthiopians</i> made some of their Monuments
of Glass, as <cite>Herodotus</cite>, Lib. 3. cap. 6. relates in these
Words: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deinde Cippum ei cavum e Vitro, quod apud
illos multum est, &amp; facile effoditur, circumdant: In ejus
medio Mortuus interlucet, ut ab Hominibus conspici queat,
&amp;c.</span></i> <i>Afterwards they enclose him in a Coffin of Glass,
which is plentiful with them and easily dug: In the
midst of it the dead Body so shines, that he may be seen of
all.</i> <i>Alexander ab Alexandro</i>, Lib. 6. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gen. Dier.</span></i>, cap. 14.
says, The <i>Egyptians</i> had three sorts of Sepulchres, one
of great Expence, which cost a Talent of Silver, another
of 20 <i>Minæ</i>, and a third kind of smaller Cost and
Value; but the <i>Æthiopians</i> were more famous for their
Monuments, those of the richer Sort being made of
Gold, the middle kind of Silver, and the poorer ones
of Earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Funeral-Ceremonies</i> how and when useful.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>But I fear, Sir, you’ll think I have digress’d too
much from my Subject of <i>Embalming</i>, yet what I
have said, was in order to shew how far Funeral-Rites
and Ceremonies are useful and allowable, when accompany’d
with this Art, and on the contrary, how
vain and ridiculous they are when us’d without it,
especially if they do but in the least exceed the Bounds
of Modesty and Frugality. What tho’ other Ceremonies
be perform’d with the greatest Splendor and
Exactness, they can give no other Satisfaction than
the Decency of Burial, or performing perhaps the
Will of the Dead; for the Body will nevertheless stink,
corrupt, and it may be startle the nearest Friend to see
it a while after? Then shall his Bones not be known,
nor his Ashes be distinguish’d from another Mans, nay
even from common Earth, so that the parcimonious
Heir may well reflect, how vain and needless it would
have been to have bestow’d more than a decent Expence
on his Funeral. Nor does it signifie much
which way the Body be dissolv’d, in regard it comes
to the same End without <i>Embalming</i>, and that such
Tombs, how splendid soever, are but in effect <i>Cenotaphs</i>
or empty Sepulchres, except that they are full of
Stench and Rottenness:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Funeral-Expences</i> insignificant without <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
We must therefore look upon
it as the most extravagant Vanity to erect Pyramids,
Obelisks, Tombs, <i>&amp;c.</i> for preserving an empty
airy Name and meer Shadow, while we neglect to
keep any Remains of that noble Workmanship the
Body, whereby to distinguish Man from Earth and
Dust. That these Practices are not commendable is
plainly prov’d in St. <i>Matthew</i>’s Gospel, <i>Chap.</i> 23. 27,
29. where our <i>Saviour</i> describing Hypocrites, compares
them to such Tombs and Sepulchres, in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Words, <i>Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites,
for ye are like unto whited Sepulchres, which indeed
appear beautiful without, but within are full of
dead Mens Bones and all Uncleanness</i>. That is, the rigid
<i>Jews</i> affected plaister’d and whited Sepulchres, in
Cadaverous and corrupted Burials, garnishing their
Tombs only outwardly, when within they were full
of Stench and Rottenness: But we shall endeavour to
prove, that of all Funeral-Ceremonies, <i>Embalming</i> is
the chief and most useful, without which, all the rest
are but vain, expensive and insignificant Customs.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Why the Body is to be taken Care of.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
We are not ignorant some may object why the Body
should be so much taken Care of, since by Death there
is a separation made of the Soul, that more noble
Part being fled, while the baser only is left. To this
we must assent, that the Body is depriv’d much of its
Dignity and Worth by such a Separation, inasmuch
as it is but an ignoble Lump in respect of the Soul,
yet are we not to neglect and despise it, but rather
to esteem it the more for the Souls sake, in that it has
once been in a happy State of conjunction with it,
and that it shall again come to be reunited therewith.
The Soul, says <cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 105. knowing it self by Divine
Instinct to be Immortal, does in a manner desire the
Body, her belov’d Companion, may, as far as may be,
enjoy the like Felicity with her, giving by lofty Monuments,
and the Duties of Funerals, all possible Eternity
with her. With this <i>Hen. Salmuth</i>, <i>Comment. in
Panciroll.</i> <i>Pars</i> 1. pag. 336. agrees, saying, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Consentaneum
est Veritati &amp; Observantiæ, imo indubitatum est Sapientibus,
quædam nobis cognata esse Semina Immortalitatis;
cujus adeo appetentes sumus, ut etiam Sepulturæ prospiciamus,
&amp; nolimus Cadaver nostrum male haberi. Humanum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Ingenium quod Animæ nostræ vis est, cum se sciat
Immortale, optat etiam ut Corpus ipsum quoq; &amp; Comes
&amp; Domicilium suum quoad fieri potest eadem Fælicitate
perfruatur.</span></i> <i>It is both agreeable to Truth and Observation,
and not to be doubted by Wise Men, that there are in
us some innate Seeds of Immortality, which we so desirously
seek, as to take Care both of our Sepulture, and
that our Carcass be not ill treated. Human Understanding,
which is the Force of the Soul, knowing it self Immortal,
desires also the Body, which is its Companion and
Habitation, may enjoy as much as may be the same Felicity
she her self has.</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Soul</i> concern’d at the Usage of the <i>Body</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For tho’ the Body be not sensible,
yet the Soul which cannot die, mourns sadly
when its Companion is either ill treated or neglected;
but on the contrary rejoyces when it is Honour’d and
taken Care of. This <i>Lucretius</i> hints at, where he shews
how Man, who whilst living, knows what will happen
after Death, as that his Body shall corrupt or be
devour’d by Birds, Beasts, <i>&amp;c.</i> or burn’d by Fire, commiserates
himself for not having been created Immortal,
and consequently departs out of this World regretfully,
see <i>p.</i> 23. This is also farther confirm’d by
<i>Julius Cæsar Scaliger</i>, Lib. 3. <cite>Poetices</cite>, cap. 20. who
says, Altho’ the dead Body neither perceives what
Condition it is in, nor is any longer with the Soul,
yet Man when living has a Sense of all those things
his Body must undergo after his Dissolution. Now
if Death were only ceasing to be, act or breath, then
were that State most desirable, inasmuch as Man
would then only rest from his Labours, and be by
this means freed from the Troubles and Afflictions of
this Life. Whereas on the contrary to be dissolv’d or
to become a Prey to ravenous Beasts, Birds and Fishes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>or an Heritage to Serpents and Worms, is ungrateful
to our Thoughts, miserable to our Sight, and unpleasant
to all our Senses; such a State being not only disagreeable
to our Nature, but also dishonouring and
debasing of the Noble Image of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, <i>pag.</i> 9. and 10.
’Tis this occasions great sadness of Mind to Man whilst
living, and makes him die the more regretfully: It
grieves him exceedingly to think what a miserable
Object of Mortality he is like to prove after Death,
how ugly and deform’d, how offensive to his Friends,
and only fit for the Conversation of such new born
Insects and Reptiles as are bred out of, and live by
Stench and Corruption. What a <i>Metathesis</i> is this!
that he who perhaps was born of Royal Blood, and
kept Company with Kings and Princes, shall now cry
out with <i>Job</i>, 17. 14. <i>To Corruption, thou art my Father;
To the Worm, thou art my Mother and Sister</i>. Whereas
on the contrary, he who is assur’d of being <i>Embalm’d</i>,
and having all other Funeral-Rites perform’d to him,
closes his Eyes in full satisfaction of lying undisturb’d
in his Grave, as in his Bed, and enjoying Eternal Rest.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Therefore the <i>Body</i> is to be taken Care of.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Besides, other Considerations may induce us to take
Care of the Body; for would you not think it a
strange Disgrace for a Prince to dwell in a Hutt, and
his Jewels and other Riches to be laid up in a Sink of
Filthiness? Surely such as the Prince is, such ought to be
the Palace wherein he dwells, and such as are the Jewels,
such ought to be the Cabbinet that contains them.
The Soul is the most precious Thing in this World, and
accordingly <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> has enclos’d it with a Cover, the
Body, the most beautifully compos’d next to it that
can be; Shall we despise therefore this Cover, because
Death has separated it from the Soul? No, let us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>rather esteem it the more, and take the more Care to
preserve it, inasmuch as it has once been the Casket of
that noble Jewel, and is the only Way of representing
that Divine Form which <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> Almighty was pleas’d
to impress on it. We may perhaps vainly please our
selves with having the Picture of our deceas’d Friend,
which nevertheless consists but of a few Lights and
Shadows, or it may be we have his Statue, which
however wants the natural Complection and Air of
his Person: ’Tis true Pictures or Statues may preserve
in our Minds our Friends Memories, and so in some
measure redeem them from the Injuries of Oblivion,
yet will they still but very faintly and imperfectly represent
that Body, to which <i>Embalming</i> gives a real
Presence, and which may at any Time be essay’d by
our Senses. <i>Aristotle</i> adds farther, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpore in Putredinem
abeunte, nec Anima amare, nec reminisci potest</span></i>. <i>That
the Soul neither remembers nor loves the Body when Putrify’d</i>;
which is agreeable to the Opinion of the
<i>Egyptians</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Egyptians</i> Belief of a dead Body.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who pleasantly conceited, that the Soul
only left the Body when it was Corrupt and Putrify’d,
as abhorring so loathsome an Habitation; whereas on
the contrary, it never forsook it when it was preserv’d
uncorrupt and entire. For this reason they, with
extraordinary Art and Care, <i>Embalm’d</i> their Dead,
that so the Body by the Cleanliness of its Mansion, by
its being deliciously perfum’d and dighted with all
the Aromatic and Odoriferous Spices and Gums of
<i>Arabia</i>, and in a word, by its being dress’d in fine Linnen,
might court and incline its best Companion, the
Soul, to cohabit with it (<i>Prov.</i> 7. 16, 17.) Methinks so
good an Example from Heathens might excite us to
take more Care of our inanimate Part. We are apt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>enough to respect the Outsides of other Things, and
set a Value on their Insides accordingly; Why therefore
should we not with our utmost Care support our
earthly Tabernacle from the fatal Ruins of Death,
that it may thereby continue in one State, like the
<i>Israelites</i> Cloaths, without Wearing or Corrupting,
and be Tenantable at any Time, whenever the Soul
shall return to inhabit it again? Now as we are all
desirous of Immortality, so ought we likewise to be
of Eternity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The desire of Living is as natural as the necessity of
Dying inevitable, and some have spared no means to
render themselves Immortal, if Human Nature could
possibly have arriv’d at that State, but finding Death
inexorable and irresistable, they alter’d their Measures
by inventing a thousand ways to perpetuate their Memories
after their Dissolution; as by erecting Pyramids,
Obelisks and Monuments of surprizing Magnificence,
on which they engrav’d Inscriptions capable as they
thought to resist Time, and to endure to Eternity.
Yet of all Methods us’d to preserve and perpetuate the
Memories of the Dead,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i> the best way of preserving the <i>Memory</i> of the <i>Dead</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it may justly be said of <i>Embalming</i>,
that that Art has ever been most approv’d
by the Polite Nations, as being undeniably the most
considerable and efficacious Means to answer their Intention.
For the utmost Care in erecting Monuments,
<i>&amp;c.</i> yields but an obscure and imperfect Idea of the Person
deceas’d, whereas by <i>Embalming</i>, that very Person is
known to be preserv’d: Besides, if I may use the Words
of Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i> in his <i>Hydriotaphia</i>, <i>Who knows the
Fate of his Bones, or how often he is to be bury’d? Who has
the Oracle of his Ashes, or where they are to be scatter’d?</i>
To be dug out of our Graves, have our Skulls made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Drinking-Cups, and our Bones turn’d into Pipes or
Dice to delight and sport our Enemies, shew Juglers
Tricks, or divert Gamesters: To have Drums made of
our Skins, to please Children or terrifie in Battel, <i>&amp;c.</i>
These are tragical Abominations to dying Persons, the
Consideration whereof methinks should occasion us
to take more care of our Interment. Now <i>Embalming</i>
prevents all these Things, not the common sort,
for that is equally terrible to some People, but such as
is perform’d without cutting, slashing or Embowelling,
which I shall hereafter shew. There are some indeed
who object against all kinds of <i>Embalming</i>, and this
because they think them contrary to Scripture and
the Fate pronounc’d to Man,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i> not contrary to the <i>Scriptures</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Gen.</i> 3. 19. but this and
all other such like Scruples we shall fully clear, by
examining what Man is, that <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> should be so
mindful of him (<i>Psalm</i> 8. 4.) and that notwithstanding
his Transgression, he should so love him, as to be careful
of preserving him both in Life and Death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Man’s Elogium.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>Man the Master-Piece of the Omniscient Architect,
is but little inferiour to the Angels themselves, being
made after <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s own Image; for his Use all other
Creatures were made and put in Subjection to him:
He alone was endu’d with a Rational and Immortal
Soul, a beautiful Symmetry of Body, an Angelic
Form, and a Countenance erect to Admire and Worship
his Creator. The inquisitive Anatomist can never
sufficiently investigate the noble Contrivance of his
Organs; the profoundest Naturalist give Reasons for,
or the most exquisite Mathematician pretend to imitate
so Divine a Mechanism. Here’s a Subject of
Contemplation for a Divine, or of a Psalm for the
Royal Prophet, to shew how wonderfully Man is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>form’d and crown’d with Glory and Honour, to live
for ever and not see Corruption:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>His <i>Transgression</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But alass! of how
short duration was this happy State? He was no sooner
plac’d in Paradise, than, being puff’d up with
Pride, he grew disobedient and transgress’d; so that
his Happiness was immediately chang’d into a Curse,
<i>That all his Days should be but Trouble and Sorrow,
and he at length return to the Dust from whence he was
taken</i>. Thus the latter part of <i>Adam</i>’s Curse was,
that he should die and moulder away, whereas, had
he not transgress’d, his Body had probably never been
destroy’d, but translated. He would not then have
undergon either Death or Corruption, nor would his
Body have suffer’d so long a Separation from his Soul;
for in that State the Body was no less pure than the
Soul, it was every way to be admir’d, honour’d and
esteem’d. It was, in a word, nam’d <i>The Temple of
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em></i>, but thro’ Sin Man was curst with Sickness and
Infirmities whilst alive, and lastly, with Death, the
shamefullest Reproach, thereby to suffer the Corruption
of the Grave, and be Food to the vilest Reptiles of
the Earth. Now as the Body was once pure as well
as the Soul, so is the Soul by Sin contaminated and
defil’d as well as the Body, both being made liable to
Corrupt and Putrifie thro’ the Curse of Death, and
to be like the Beasts of the Field which perish Eternally.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>And <i>Redemption</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>But <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, out of his infinite Love and Mercy to
Mankind, sent his blessed Son as a Redeemer, to make
Atonement for Man’s Original Sin, whereby the Curse
of his Transgression was wip’d away, and Victory
over Death and the Grave obtain’d. Again, As <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>
has appointed as a Blessing, Physicians for curing Diseases,
that Man might enjoy a tolerable state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Health, till remov’d from this Life, so has he in Death
likewise given them a Knowledge to preserve them
Incorruptible, which is the promis’d Blessing, 1 <i>Cor.</i>
15. that tho’ our Flesh be Corruptible, yet shall it
put on Incorruption (by <i>Embalming</i>) and tho’ we are
Mortal and die, yet shall we become Immortal, and
so both Death and Sin be conquer’d by Life Eternal.
Now this may as well be understood in a Literal
Sense, agreeable to our Subject, as in a Spiritual one;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalm’d Bodies</i> Sleep ’till the <i>Resurrection</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for Bodies Embalm’d as aforesaid, seem not to be dead,
but only asleep, waiting for the Resurrection. For
this Reason the <i>Hebrews</i> call’d their Burying-Places
<i>Houses of the Living</i>, and the <i>Christians</i> nam’d theirs
<i>Dormitories</i> or <cite>Sleeping-Places</cite>, p. 17. where Bodies rest
in their Tombs as in their Beds. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non Mortua, sed data
Somno</span></i>, says <i>Prudentius</i>. <i>Their Bodies are not dead,
but asleep</i>; for Death to <i>Christians</i> is but Sleeping, and
Sleeping Rest, out of which they hope and expect to be
awak’d at the joyful Day of Resurrection, well knowing
it is no more difficult with <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> to raise them
from Death than Sleep; so that to them Death is but
as it were a mute <i>Interludium</i> to the Resurrection, a
Cessation of Labour and Action, and differs from Life
only in Motion and Speech:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Death</i> compar’d
to <i>Sleep</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For this Reason Death
is rightly compar’d to Sleep, as being a Refreshment
during the Night of this World, till the Morning of
the next. Thus <i>Jesus</i> told the By-Standers, <i>Matth.</i> 9.
24. <i>The Maid is not dead, but sleepeth</i>. <i>And that Lazarus</i>
(who was <i>Embalm’d</i> and restor’d to Life again)
<i>slept</i>, John 11. 11. which the better to explain he
afterwards told them he was dead, <i>ver.</i> 14. It is also
written of the Martyr St. <i>Stephen</i> that he fell asleep,
<cite>Acts</cite> 7. 60. See also <i>Dan.</i> 12. 2. and 1 <i>Thess.</i> 4. 13. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>this way of speaking was more especially us’d in the
Old Testament, as I have already observ’d, <i>p.</i> 36. <i>Prudentius</i>’s
Hymn <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad Galli Cantum</span></cite>, p. 30. and that <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ante
Somnum</span></cite>, p. 46. excellently well compare Death to
Sleep, Sleep to Death, and Waking to the Resurrection.
<i>Sleep</i>, says Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i> in his <cite>Religio Medici</cite>,
p. 43. <i>is so like Death, that I dare not trust it without
my Prayers, and an half Adieu to the World, taking

<p class='c009'><i>This is the Dormitive I take to Bedward</i>, says my Author,
<i>I need no better Hypnotic to make me sleep; after
which I close mine Eyes in Security, content to take my
leave of the Sun, and to sleep ’till the Resurrection</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now what this Learn’d Author says of <i>Sleep</i>, the
same may be said of <i>Embalming</i>; for this Art prevents
the Corruption of the Grave, so that the Body will
remain entire, and as it were asleep in its Bed, ’till
awak’d by the last Trumpet to a joyful Resurrection,
<i>where in its Flesh it shall see <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em></i>, Job 19. 26. and
become Spiritual and Immortal. Hereby Death has
no more Power over us than a long Sleep, which refreshes
us from our Labours, and makes us arise in that
Everlasting Morning unweary’d and undefil’d to enjoy
a perfect State of Bliss for ever. Besides, this Benefit
accrues from seeing Bodies thus preserv’d, that Men
are thereby put in mind of that most desirable and delectable
Mystery of the Resurrection.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i> an Emblem of the <i>Resurrection</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>So we also that
employ our Time and Labour in</i> Embalming, says <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gabriel
Clauder in Methodo Balsamandi</span></i>, p. 11. <i>have before our
Eyes, as it were in a Looking-Glass, a Præludium and Argument
of the Resurrection, a Symbol of our Future Integrity,
and Testimony of our Faith of the hoped for Incorruptibility
and Everlasting Eternity</i>. The <i>Pagans</i> themselves
were not without some Hopes of this nature,
as appears from the extraordinary Care they bestow’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>on their Sepulchres and <i>Embalmings</i>. Very remarkable
is the civiliz’d Sepulture of the antient Inhabitants
of <i>Teneriffe</i>, who Embalm’d their Dead with singular
Art, and afterwards plac’d them in deep Caves in several
Postures, such as standing, lying, sitting, <i>&amp;c.</i>
These Burying-Places they look on only as Dormitories,
and rarely admit any one without leave to go into
them, seeming as tho’ they would not have them disturb’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Inhabitants of a Country call’d <i>Zeilan</i>, as <i>Aria
Montanus</i> relates, do not bury their Dead, but <i>Embalm</i>
them with various Aromatics, which done, they dress
them in fine Cloaths, and afterwards set them on
Benches, according to their distinct Families and Quality,
whereby they appear as if alive, and any one may
there know his Father, Grandfather, Great Grandfather,
or any other of his Predecessors or Family to a
long extent of Time. Much the same is reported of
some of the <i>Chineses</i>, <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>West-Indians</i>, <i>Egyptians</i>
and others, of whom we shall give a full account
in their proper Places. Now if the <i>Heathens</i>, who
either did not believe, or would not own the Resurrection
of the Flesh, were so careful in <i>Embalming</i>
their Dead, much less are we to neglect it, who wait
the Resurrection of our frail Bodies, and expect when
they shall become Incorruptible, Spiritual and Immortal,
eternally enjoying the most perfect state of Bliss
and Happiness: Besides, we <i>Christians</i> ought to esteem
<i>Embalming</i> a pious Work,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Acceptable to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
acceptable to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, because
it frees us from that Corruption which he so much
detests, and has so often pronounc’d and threatn’d
as his severest Judgment, <i>p.</i> 38, 39. <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> Almighty
has many Times permitted Mankind as well as Brutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and Vegetables, so to petrifie without any Human
Help or Assistance, as to remain for ever free from
Putrefaction or Corruption, and sometimes has effected
the same preservation of the Bodies of the
Faithful, without any manifest alteration, but only a
little attenuation or dryness, and that without any ill
Savour. Thus the Bodies of several Martyrs and
Holy Men have been found in most Ages, especially
those in the <i>Kiovian Cryptæ</i> or Vaults, which <i>Herbinius</i>
describes, and looks on as an Instance of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s
Love, and Reward of their Piety and Virtues; Why
therefore should we think <i>Embalming</i>, or the artificial
Preserving of Bodies, either displeasing to <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> or
unbecoming a <i>Christian</i>, since we have so many Instances
and Examples to the contrary? The Scriptures
testifie that <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s antient People the <i>Hebrews</i> <i>embalm’d</i>
their Dead, and that the Patriarchs <i>Jacob</i> and
<i>Joseph</i> were both <i>embalm’d</i>; so also <i>Joseph</i> of <i>Arimathæa</i>
and <i>Nicodemus</i>, following the Footsteps of their
Ancestors, honour’d the Body of our <i>Saviour</i> with
<i>Embalming</i>. This <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> Almighty was pleas’d to
permit, because, as <i>David</i> says, <i>He would not suffer his
Holy One to see Corruption</i>, Psal. 16. 10. Now as Christ
was bury’d to shew he was really dead, so was he <i>embalm’d</i>
in order to his Resurrection; and as his Holy
Body was no ways defil’d with Original Sin, so also
thro’ the special Privilege bestow’d on it by <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>,
was it exempt from the Laws of Corruption. Now
this is moreover remarkable, that before our <i>Saviour</i>
was born for the Redemption of Mankind, lost by
<i>Adam</i>’s Transgression, <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> shew’d a more than ordinary
Instance of his Love to Man, by the preservation
of Holy <i>Enoch</i> and <i>Elijah</i>, both who, had they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>been bury’d,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Enoch</i> and <i>Elijah</i> neither dy’d nor corrupted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
must of consequence corrupted under
that Curse, <i>Gen.</i> 3. 19. wherefore that they might not
undergo those Alterations there threatn’d, <i>viz.</i> Death
and Corruption, <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> Almighty translated them:
These two with our <i>Saviour</i> are the only Instances of
a visible Ascention, and who suffer’d no Corruption.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Embalming</i> approv’d by our <i>Saviour</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>To these Reasons we may add what Christ himself
witnesses, that he was so far from being displeas’d at
the <i>Embalming</i> his Body, that he chid those about him,
when they were angry at the Womans pouring such
precious Nard Ointment on his Head, which, as they
alledg’d, might have better been sold for more than
Three Hundred Pence (about 10 <i>l.</i> of our Mony) and
given to the Poor, <i>Mark</i> 14. 6, 8, 9. <i>Jesus said, let
her alone, why trouble ye her? She hath wrought a good
Work on me, she is come aforehand to anoint my Body to
the Burial. Verily I say unto you, wheresoever this
Gospel shall be preach’d throughout the whole World, this
also that she hath done shall be spoken of, for a Memorial
of her.</i> In a word, this <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i> is sufficiently
warranted both by the Old and New Testament,
and equally celebrated by <i>Jewish</i>, <i>Christian</i> and <i>Heathen</i>
Writers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having now done with my Theological Arguments,
I shall next proceed to vindicate the <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i>
by some Physical and Political Reasons. <i>First</i> then,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i>, in a general Sense, very Extensive.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If we take this Art in a general Sense of preserving
the Memory of Man, as well as his Body, we shall
find it very Extensive and Infinite, since both the Industry
and Ingenuity of the Ancients have not only
sought after the surest Means of effecting this, but
likewise invented and contriv’d whatever else might
preserve the Body, transmit its Name to Posterity, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Fame to Eternity. Some have for this end erected
Pyramids, Obelisks, Columns, Temples, Statues and a
thousand other Things, whereby they imagin’d they
might secure their Names from Oblivion; whereas
others thought Poems, Epigrams, Epitaphs and such
like Writings were the best and securest Monuments.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Writings</i> thought the best <i>Monuments</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of this Opinion was <i>Horace</i>, who, at the end of his
Third Book, thus boasts of his Works:</p>

and his <i>Metamorphosis</i> in these Words:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And now the Work is finish’d, which <i>Jove</i>’s Rage,</div>

<p class='c009'>Both these Poetical Flourishes may be esteem’d a
kind of <i>Embalming</i> their Authors Actions and Names;
for as the aforesaid historical Structures preserve and
record our Actions, so are our Thoughts and Sayings
<i>embalm’d</i> as it were by Writings.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Fame</i> the <i>Goddess</i> of <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In this respect <i>Fame</i>
may not improperly be call’d the <i>Goddess</i> and <i>Patroness</i>
of <i>Embalming</i>, and <i>Mercury</i> her chief Minister to proclaim
to the World the Heroic Acts of Memorable
and Famous Men: Thus all Things intended to preserve
a Name, whether Pictures, Statues, Medals, Buildings
or Writings, may be comprehended under this
general Sense of <i>Embalming</i>; nevertheless, experience
teaches us the preservation of a Body by the <i>Balsamic
Art</i> is not only the best way of reviving Mens Memories,
and bringing their Merits fresh in our Minds,
but also the most durable,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i> the most durable Thing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for not only Tombs and
Statues have decay’d in a few Years, but also whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Towns and Cities have been ruin’d and demolish’d
within the Revolution of an Age, and that so, as hardly
to have one Stone left to witness what they have
been; whereas <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies have been found entire
after Thousands of Years. Neither is <i>Embalming</i>
to be commended only for its Duration,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Useful in <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>Physic</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but likewise
for its great Use in <i>Phisiology</i>, <i>Natural Philosophy</i> and
<i>Physic</i>, as we have hinted before, <i>p.</i> 2, 3, 4. In that we
thereby know how to conserve all sorts of Herbs,
Juices, <i>&amp;c.</i> keep all kinds of Flesh and Fish, and preserve
all sorts of Plants, rare Exotics, and such like
Curiosities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In <i>Anatomy</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Embalming</i> is likewise particularly useful in <i>Anatomy</i>,
inasmuch as it teaches how Bodies may be preserv’d,
that the most minute Parts may be Dissected, and
such Preparations made as will remain to Posterity,
and serve instead of Books, Sculptures or Pictures, by
which the Disposition of the Human Fabric may be
more accurately distinguish’d, and the Names and Uses
of the Parts easier retain’d in our Memories.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In <i>Surgery</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>It is also particularly useful to <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i>,
<i>First</i>, In that by opening such Bodies, they may
presently see the Nature and Cause of Diseases. And,
<i>Secondly</i>, by understanding what <i>Fermentation</i> and <i>Putrefaction</i>
are, together with the Virtues and Qualities
of <i>Embalming</i>-Drugs that prevent and resist them,
they may be better able to cure malignant Feavers,
Mortifications, <i>&amp;c.</i> See <i>p.</i> 3, 4. for no sooner is there
a Separation of the Soul from the Body, but an immediate
tendency to Putrefaction follows: The florid
colour of the Face vanishes, the Belly swells, the Entrails
turn green and fœtid, and the extreme Parts become
shrivel’d and contracted; when we may well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>cry out, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quantum mutatus ab illo!</span></i> So suddain an Alteration
ensues without a previous <i>Balsamation</i>. What
obdurate Hearts and pitiless Eyes can then bear such
a miserable Object, when <i>Embalming</i> so easily prevents
it, by rendring the Body sweet and decorous, retaining
still its natural Form, Feature and Shape? Again,
if we consider the natural and innate Desire most People
have of being bury’d in their own Tombs and
Countries,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Necessary for <i>Transporting Bodies</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we shall find there is a necessity of <i>Embalming</i>
such Bodies, the better to convey those that die
in Foreign Parts to their Native Soil. Thus <i>Jacob</i> and
<i>Joseph</i> were transported from <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Canaan</i>, whereas,
had their Bodies not been <i>embalm’d</i>, they must necessarily
have corrupted in their Journey; but as for
the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, who were not well acquainted
with this Art, they were forc’d to burn such Bodies as
dy’d abroad, and were contented only to bring home
their Ashes, which <i>Ovid</i> seems so very desirous of in
the following Verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ossa tamen facito parva referantur in Urna,</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic Ego non etiam Mortuus, Exul ero.</span></i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let but my Country have my Funeral-Urn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And after Death, tho’ exil’d, I’ll return.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now certainly they would have thought it much better
to have brought over the whole Body than part
of it, had they been but skillful enough to have <i>embalm’d</i>
it; for there is no other difference between Incineration
and Putrefaction, than length of Time,
therefore both are equally to be avoided. Nay, some of
the <i>Heathens</i> themselves have judg’d it an Impiety towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the Dead, either to commit them to the Fire,
or to Worms and Corruption, therefore they endeavour’d,
as much as in them lay, to <i>Embalm</i> and Preserve
them thereby from both. Now nothing is more
evident, than that those who intend to preserve a Body
entire, ought neither to burn nor bury it, but keep
it in a proper Repository, contriv’d to resist the Injuries
of Time and Weather, and which is neither expos’d
nor obnoxious to Putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>To Conclude, <i>Embalming</i> not only prevents the
Plague and Putrefaction, and consequently frees from
the Terror and Deformity of Death, <i>page</i> 9, 11, 12.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Secures from the Insults of Animals, <i>&amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but likewise defends and secures dead Bodies from Insults
of Brutes and Insects, by reason of its bitter
ungrateful Taste: Yet considering the antient Way
of the <i>Egyptians</i> by rowling, and the modern by
wrapping up in Cerecloaths, so obscure the Object,
and also are so imperfect on several other Accounts;
I have endeavour’d to shew a possibility of inventing
a Method, how to preserve the whole <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Compages</span></i> of
the Body for ever without Putrefaction, in such manner,
that its Texture and Structure may remain entire,
of the same Proportion as before, and of the same
Colour and Flexibility, without any visible contraction,
diminution or unconformity of the Parts whereby the
dead Corps may be handled by the <i>Anatomists</i> without
any offensive Smell or fastidious <i>Mador</i>. St. <i>Jerome</i>,
in <i>Epitaph. Paul. Eustoch.</i> speaks thus of <i>Paulina</i> a <i>Roman</i>
Lady, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quodq; mirum sit nihil Pallor mutaverit Faciem,
sed ita Dignitas quædam omnia compleverat, ut putares
non mortuam sed dormientem</span></i>. <i>And what is wonderful,
Paleness had not in the least alter’d her Countenance,
but Majesty was so preserv’d</i> (<i>by</i> Embalming) <i>in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>every Feature, that you would not have thought her dead
but asleep</i>. Thus to preserve any heroic Prince or
great General, any noted Professor of some Science or
Faculty, <i>&amp;c.</i> would sure be a finer sight than their
<i>Effigies</i> in Wax, and withal be as durable as their
Tomb in Marble. I say, if we can arrive at this
Perfection, without Exenteration or Incision, so as to
preserve a dead Body after the manner aforesaid, it
were reasonable to believe it would not only less terrifie
all scrupulous Persons, but likewise be of greater
Use to the Common Wealth. Yet least I should fail
herein, it being an unbeaten Path, I presume thro’
your Conduct and Guidance, that whilst I am endeavouring
to find it out, you will neither suffer me to
lose my self, nor lead others out of the Way. This
is my only fear (well knowing too many Examples
of those that in making new Discoveries have Shipwreck’d
themselves) and the principal Request of,</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>As your Knowledge in the <i>Coptic</i> or antient

testifie you to be the fittest Judge of an Art of such
Antiquity as <i>Embalming</i>; so your favourable Approbation
of my Notions herein, has encourag’d me to
endeavour finding out the true Progress and exact
Method of practising that Art. In order hereunto I
first think it not amiss to give a short Geographical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Description of the Kingdom of <i>Egypt</i>, as also to take
notice of the Salubrity of its <i>Air</i> and <i>Water</i>,

to the right Understanding of this Noble but lost Art.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tho’ <i>Embalming</i> be the chiefly intended Scope of
this Letter, yet considering the <i>Egyptians</i> have been
always allow’d the first Inventors of Arts and Sciences,
and that this particular manner of <i>Embalming</i> was at
first us’d by them only, it may be requisite to consider
every particular circumstance of Time and Place,
the several Drugs, Plants, Minerals and other Advantages
which accru’d to them beyond other Nations,
and likewise to inquire into the Reasons which induc’d
them to study this Art, as also by what means and
after what manner they came to find it out.</p>

<p class='c009'>This indeed may seem to some a Digression from

a little advantageous to the Reader, besides, like the
Interlude of a Tragedy, may somewhat divert the

before I proceed to particulars, I shall speak somewhat
of <i>Egypt</i> in general,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Egypt</i>, how scituate and bounded.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which the antient Geographers
plac’d partly in <i>Africa</i> and partly in <i>Asia</i>, making the
River <i>Nile</i> the Boundary between those two great parts
of the World; but <i>Egypt</i>, according to the most common
receiv’d Opinion, is at present held to be all scituate
in <i>Africa</i>, and bounded on the <i>East</i> by <i>Idumæa</i>,
and the <i>Arabian Gulph</i> or <i>Red Sea</i>, on the <i>West</i> by the
Desarts of <i>Barca</i>, <i>Lybia</i> and <i>Numidia</i>, on the <i>North</i>

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its Denomination.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This Country, says <i>Heylin</i> in
his Cosmography, <i>p.</i> 841. has had several Names given
it by prophane Authors, as, <i>First</i>, <i>Aeria</i>, from the
Serenity of its Air, which is seldom Cloudy. <i>Secondly</i>,
<i>Potamia</i>, from the propinquity of the Sea, which washes
two sides of it. <i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Ogygia</i>, from <i>Ogyges</i>, a suppos’d
King thereof. <i>Fourthly</i>, <i>Melampodus</i>, from the
black colour of its Soil. <i>Fifthly</i>, <i>Osiria</i>, from the God
<i>Osiris</i>, here in high esteem. <i>Sixthly</i>, and lastly, it was
call’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægyptus</span></i>, which in the end prevail’d over all the
rest, either from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægyptus</span></i> Brother of <i>Danaus</i>, once
King hereof (in the Stories of this Nation better known
by the Name of <i>Rameses</i>) or else from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægyptus</span></i>, the
old Name of the River <i>Nile</i>, whose annual overflowings
bringing Soil and Rubbish from the higher Countries,
gave occasion to some to believe it rais’d into
firm Land, and gain’d out of the Sea, who therefore
call’d it <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nili Donum</span></i>, the Gift of <i>Nile</i>; yet some there
are who would have it call’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægyptus</span></i>, from <i>Aiguphtus</i>,
deriv’d from <i>Aicoptus</i>, which signifies the Land or
Country of <i>Coptus</i>, that being suppos’d to have been
antiently its chief City, built by <i>Coptus</i>, whose Genealogy
and Descent is thus describ’d by Father <i>Vansleb</i> in
his Relation of <cite>Egypt</cite>, p. 3. Cham, says he, <i>one of the
three Sons of</i> Noah, <i>had four Male Children</i>, Cus, Misraim,
Fut <i>and</i> Canaan; Cus <i>was Father of the</i> Abyssins,
Misraim <i>of the</i> Copties <i>and</i> Nubians, Fut <i>of the</i> Africans,
<i>and</i> Canaan <i>of the</i> Syrians <i>and their Neighbours</i>.
Misraim <i>after the Deluge, as</i> Macrizi <i>an Arabian Historian
says, pitch’d upon</i> Egypt, <i>made there his Abode, and
left that and the Country, as far as the farthest Part of</i>
Africa, <i>to his Posterity: He had likewise four Sons</i>, Ischemun,
Atrib, Sà <i>and</i> Coptus, <i>among whom he equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>divided the Land of</i> Egypt. Coptus <i>had all that Tract
of Land from</i> Assuan <i>or</i> Isvan <i>to the City of</i> Coptus;
Ischemun <i>all the Country from that City to</i> Menuf <i>or</i>
Memphis, Atrib <i>had the heart and middle of</i> Egypt;
<i>now call’d</i> Delta; <i>and</i> Sà <i>all the Continent, from the Province
of</i> Beheire <i>as far as</i> Barbary: <i>They all built Cities
in their several Dominions, calling them after their own
Names. After the decease of their Father, the four Brothers
were at variance about the Soveraignty, neither of
them caring to endure a Partner; at length they resolv’d
to end their Controversy by Battel, which was to give the
chief Command to the Victor.</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Govern’d by <i>Coptus</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Coptus <i>the youngest overcame
the rest, and was consequently acknowledg’d chief
Lord by all. He chose the City of</i> Menuf <i>or</i> Memphis,
<i>where his Father liv’d, for his Residence: From this first
King all the Race of the</i> Egyptians <i>have been since call’d</i>
Copties: <i>From him likewise the</i> Greeks <i>gave the Name

laid the Foundation of that Kingdom after the Deluge:
From this</i> Misraim <i>the</i> Turks <i>have also nam’d</i> Egypt
Missir, <i>which is very near the Hebrew</i> Misraim; <i>and the</i>
Jews <i>to this Day call it</i> Eretz Misraim, <i>the Country of</i>
Misraim. This may suffice as to its Denominations
and Etimology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its <i>Extent</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Nubiensis Geographia</i> makes it to extend in length
from <i>Assuan</i> to the <i>Mediterranean</i>, 25 Days Journey,
which is about 655 English Miles, and in breadth 8
Days Journey or 200 Miles; but <i>Sandys</i> and <i>Vansleb</i>
agree ’tis from <i>North</i> to <i>South</i> only 560 Miles, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>latter alledging it scarce possible to declare its length
precisely, by reason they are not wont in that Country
to measure by Miles or Leagues, but by Camels
Journeys only. As to its breadth, <i>Leo Africanus</i> says,
<i>p.</i> 296, it is from <i>East</i> to <i>West</i> 50 Miles, being narrow
towards the <i>South</i>, but broader to the <i>North</i> towards
the <i>Mediterranean</i>. <i>Sandys</i> likewise, <i>p.</i> 72. says, That
by reason of its being so contracted among barren
Mountains, it is in many Places hardly 4, in few above
8 Miles broad, till not far above <i>Cairo</i> it begins by
degrees to enlarge it self, and so continues even to the
Sea, being between <i>Rosetta</i> and <i>Damiata</i>, which stand
on the <i>West</i> and <i>East</i>-Confines of that which is overflow’d
by the natural Course of the River, 140 Miles,
and from <i>Rosetta</i> to <i>Alexandria</i> 30.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Antient and modern <i>Division</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Concerning the Division of this Country, the Ancients
have taken occasion to divide it first into high
and low, and then into high, middle and low; the
higher they call’d <i>Thebais</i>, from a Place call’d <i>Thebes</i>,
at present <i>Saida</i>; the middle they nam’d <i>Septanomos</i>,
from the seven <i>Nomi</i>, Provostships or Governments it
contain’d, at present <i>Bechira</i> or <i>Demesor</i>; the lower
and more particular <i>Egypt</i> they call’d <i>Delta</i>, from its
likeness to the Figure of the <i>Greek</i> Letter <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δ</span>. <i>Egypt</i>,
according to <cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 85. is now divided into three
Parts or Provinces; that which lies <i>South</i> of <i>Cairo</i> is
call’d <i>Sahid</i>, that between <i>Cairo</i>, <i>Rosetta</i> and <i>Alexandria</i>,
<i>Errif</i>, that between <i>Cairo</i>, <i>Damiata</i> and <i>Tenese</i>,
<i>Maremnia</i>, <i>Bechiria</i>: The <i>Pharaohs</i> and <i>Egyptian</i> Nobility
resided in <i>Saida</i>, the <i>Ptolomies</i> in <i>Errif</i>, and the
<i>Romans</i> and <i>Greeks</i> along the Sea-Coasts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The River <i>Nile</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>I must now proceed to speak of the River <i>Nile</i>,
which crossing great part of <i>Æthiopia</i>, and then entring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span><i>Egypt</i>, runs the whole length of that Kingdom,
and after dividing and spreading it self into many
Branches, ends in the <i>Mediterranean Sea</i>. This River
was thought by the Ancients not to have its equal,
and is still reputed one of the most considerable of the
World, having somewhat wonderful and peculiar to
it self, whether one considers its <i>Source</i> or <i>Effects</i>. To
this River <i>Egypt</i> ows its Fertility, and its Inhabitants
the greatest of Felicities, their Health and Fortunes,
yet neither could their rich Princes or wise Priests ever
discover its <i>Source</i> or <i>Origin</i>. ’Tis this has baffl’d the
greatest Philosophers, and withstood the Attempts of
all their Kings, <i>Roman</i> Emperors, Sultans and other
Potentates, who, notwithstanding they endeavour’d it
with vast Expenses, always prov’d unsuccessful: Thus
<i>Sesostris</i>, <i>Ptolemy</i> and <i>Cyrus</i> sought for it in vain; <i>Alexander</i>
the Great consulted the Oracle of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>
in order to find it out, and <i>Cambyses</i>, as <i>Strabo</i> witnesses,
spent a whole Year to the same purpose, yet both
were disappointed: <i>Julius Cæsar</i> also, if we may believe
<i>Lucan</i>, said, He would have given over his pursuit
of the Civil War, could he but have been sure to
find out this Secret, yet has its Spring-Head remain’d
undiscover’d till of late Years, when it was happily
pitch’d upon by the <i>Portugueses</i>, which makes me of the
Opinion of <i>Le Bruyn</i>, That no Persons are more capable
of making these Searches and Discoveries than
the <i>Roman Missionaries</i>; for on one hand they make it
their Duty and perpetual Employment to go about
everywhere gaining Proselites, and subjecting them
to the See of <i>Rome</i>, and on the other, under pretence
of Devotion, and by virtue of their poor and simple
Habit, may easily penetrate the most remote Countries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>inaccessible to other Travellers by reason of the
Dangers that are to be met with. Now ’tis certain
almost all those Missionaries, especially the <i>Jesuites</i>,
are most capable of making these Searches, by reason
of their insinuating and cunning Ways, so that making
it their Business, as they commonly do, they must be
most likely to succeed therein; ’tis therefore to their
Care and Pains we are indebted for two considerable
Discoveries, of the Source and Rise of this River; the
first made by <i>Peter Pais</i>, and the second by Father
<i>Telles</i> a Jesuit, which last being the shorter Account,
yet no less Correct, I shall here insert it as he has given
it us in his History of <i>Æthiopia</i>, printed at <i>Lisbon</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Rise and Course of the River <i>Nile</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>In the Kingdom of</i> Gojam, <i>about</i> 12 <i>Degrees from the
Equinoctial towards the</i> West, <i>and in the Province of</i> Sacahala,
<i>inhabited by the</i> Agaus, <i>in a Field of no great
extent, incompass’d by many high Mountains, is a small
Lake, over which one may cast a Stone, full of Bushes and
low Trees, whereof the Roots are so thick and intangl’d,
that in Summer one may pass over them dry shod. In the
middle of this Lake are two great and deep Fountains
very near each other, whence issues out a clear Water that
runs under these Bushes and Shrubs, in two several Channels.
Towards the</i> East, <i>and about the distance of a
Musket-Shot, they turn to the</i> North. <i>About half a Mile
from thence there appears a great deal of Water, and a
considerable River, into which run many other Streams.
About 15 Miles farther it receives another larger Water
call’d</i> Gema, <i>which looses then its Name. A little farther,
turning towards the</i> East, <i>it receives two other considerable
Streams call’d</i> Kelti <i>and</i> Branti: <i>Near this
Place is the first fall of the River; not much farther running
towards the</i> East, <i>it enters the Lake of the</i> Abyssins,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><i>nam’d</i> Bahr Dembea, <i>or the Sea of</i> Dembea. <i>When it
has pass’d through this Lake, without mingling with its
Waters, it receives many other great Rivers, and chiefly
the River</i> Tekeze <i>near</i> Egypt. <i>So soon as</i> Nile <i>is out of
the Lake</i> Dembea, <i>it turns to the</i> South-East, <i>leaving
on the left the Kingdoms of</i> Beg-amidr, Amhara <i>and</i>
Voleca; <i>afterwards running towards the</i> South, <i>it has
on the</i> South-East <i>the Kingdom of</i> Sauva, <i>and then
turning again to</i> East-North-East, <i>has on the</i> South,
Ganz, Gafata <i>and</i> Bizamo, <i>passing through the Countries
of</i> Gonga <i>and</i> Gafre; <i>a little farther it passes by</i> Fascalo,
<i>then enters the Country of</i> Funch <i>or</i> Nubia, <i>whence it
runs into</i> Egypt, <i>as Father</i> Telles <i>affirms</i>. But how it
is there distributed and divided, I shall shew by and
by, after I have mention’d two of its Principal <i>Cataracts</i>
or <i>Cascades</i> of a surprizing Nature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its <i>Cataracts</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>One of these is at <i>Ilack</i>, in <i>Numidia</i>, and the other
above <i>Siene</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, being 12 Days Journey from
each other. <i>Ptolomy</i> calls the most Southern, the
<i>Great Cataract</i>, and the other, which he places about
<i>Siene</i>, now <i>Assuan</i>, the <i>Lesser</i>. This falls about 50 foot,
but the other three times as high, which last rouling
off the Rocks into a vast Abyss, the Waters, says <cite>Sandys</cite>,
p. 73. make such a roaring Noise, that a Colony,
planted there by the <i>Persians</i>, were made almost Deaf
with it, and glad to abandon their Habitations, tho’
otherwise plentifully provided with all Necessaries of
Life. The adjoyning People nevertheless are of that
incredible boldness, that daring to commit themselves
in little Boats (capable of holding only two, whereof
the one Steers and the other Rows) unto the raging
Current, and impetuous Eddies, have been seen to
pass the Streights of the Rocks by little Channels, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>at length to rush down with the Stream, to the amazement
of all Beholders, who giving them up for lost,
beheld them a while after as if shot out of an Engin,
far from the place of their Fall, rowing safely in the
asswaged Waters; but <i>Danet</i> will not allow the Noise
made by the Cataracts, renders the neighbouring
Inhabitants Deaf, tho’ the same may be heard 3 Days
Journey off, and the Waters which rush down appear
like Smoak, being forc’d with so great a violence, that
they form a kind of Arch, and leave so great a space
between, that a Man may pass it without being wet:
There are also Seats cut under the Rocks, where Travellers
may rest themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other <i>Cascade</i>, as <cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 73. tells us, is a
little above the place where once stood the City <i>Elephantis</i>:
There two pointed Rocks nam’d <i>Crophi</i> and
<i>Mophi</i>, or the Veins of <i>Nilus</i>, lift up their eminent
Heads, making the lesser Cataract by falling down
with a furious Cascade into the upper <i>Egypt</i>; then running
from <i>South</i> to <i>North</i> very leisurely, it divides its self
into two navigable Branches. That towards the <i>East</i>
runs into the Midland Sea near <i>Damiata</i>, heretofore
<i>Pelusium</i>, while the other inclining to the <i>West</i>, and formerly
call’d <i>Canopus</i>, falls into the self same Sea a
little below <i>Rosetta</i>, making, of the richest Portion of
the Land of <i>Egypt</i>, a triangular Island, call’d <i>Delta</i>,
in that being thus inclos’d between these two Branches
and the Sea, it bears the form of that Letter. Two
other Branches there are which run between these, but
poor in Water, besides divers Channels cut by the
Labour of Man, for better Conveyance during the
Time of Inundation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its <i>Ostiaries</i> or <i>Mouths</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span><cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Strabo</i> reckon up seven Mouths of
the <i>Nile</i>, but <i>Egypt</i> has been so much chang’d since
their Time, that there is hardly any appearance or remembrance
of the seven Cities they mention. <i>Ptolemy</i>,
in his Geography, expresly gives the names of nine;
but surely most of them must have been stop’d up by
the Sands, since at present there are but three or four
at most, as is affirm’d by <i>William</i> Arch-Bishop of <i>Tyre</i>,
in his IX. Book, <cite>De Bell. Sac.</cite> cap. 33. and by <i>Le Bruyn</i> in
his Voyage to the <cite>Levant</cite>, p. 161. who went on purpose
to make such Discoveries. But this is however
remarkable, that the fresh Waters of the <i>Nile</i>, keeping
themselves united in a Body, and falling into the
salt Water or Sea, change the Colour of the <i>Mediterranean</i>
farther than any part thereof can be seen from
the Shore.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its <i>Inundation</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Yet amongst all the Misteries of Nature,
none is more wonderful than the Overflowing of this
River, nor any Thing more Beneficial; since to this
alone the Inhabitants owe not only their Riches but
their Health, the most malignant Diseases immediately
ceasing at the Approach of it, and Famine and Dearth
are as quickly expell’d. It brings a Mirth and Joy to
those People, and of a meer Desart it was before,
for such is <i>Egypt</i> unwater’d by the <i>Nile</i>, makes that
Country the most fruitful of any in the habitable
World.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the Earth, which had been so long scorch’d
by the violent heat of the Sun, is plentifully refresh’d
with abundant Waters, and the very Cattel seem to
rejoyce at the approaching verdant Season: Boats are
row’d where not long before Men trod, and the Waters
fill up the dusty Channels and long empty’d Cisterns,
covering in many Places the whole superficies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the Land, making it appear as a troubl’d Lake. Nor
is this an unpleasant sight to the Natives, who think
the less they see of their Country, the more their
Comfort will be. During this Inundation they keep
their Beasts and Cattel on the tops of such little Hills,
as either the Providence of Nature, or Industry of Man
has prepar’d, where they abide, waiting patiently for
the decrease of the Waters. On these Hills also stand
most of their Towns and Villages, appearing, in the
time of the Flood; like so many Islands, the People
in the mean Time holding Commerce and continual
Traffick, by intercourse of Boats and Shallops, in
which they transport their marketable Commodities
from one Place to another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Time of its Increase.</div>

<p class='c009'>This Increase of Waters begins about the 16th or
17th of <i>June</i>, when the <i>Nile</i> swells above its Banks
for the space of 40 Days, and in as many more gathers
its Waters again to their proper Bounds; so that its
greatest height is about the end of <i>July</i>, and decrease
about the beginning of <i>September</i>. If it begins sooner
or later, the People give Judgment whether there will
be more or less Water, and consequently are advertis’d
to the end they may take Order for what they
have to do. The Increase is known by certain Pillars
in their Towns, and particularly in the Castle of
<i>Roude</i>, which stands in a little Isle opposite to old
<i>Cairo</i>, where the <i>Bassa</i> resides, during the Solemnity
of opening the <i>Khalis</i> or Channel, which passes thro’
and fills the Cisterns of <i>Grand Cairo</i>. It is also known
in the Fields by <i>Asps</i>, <i>Tortoises</i>, <i>Crawfish</i>, <i>Crocodiles</i>, &amp;c.
who remove their Eggs or Young from the Banks of
the <i>Nile</i>, immediately before the Inundation, and lay
them up where they may be preserv’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its Effects.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Now answerable to the Increase of this River is
the Plenty or Scarcity of the succeeding Year. <i>Heylin</i>
in his Cosmography writes, If it flow not to the height
of 15 Cubits, then the Earth will be deficient in her
Abundance or Increase for want of Moisture; and if
it surmount the superficies of the Earth, more than
17 Cubits, then, like a drunken Man, it cannot produce
its natural Operation, having its Stomach cloy’d
and surcharg’d as it were with too much Liquor;
but if a moderate flowing happen, then can no Country
boast of a like Fertility, the Flood bringing with
it both Earth and Water into a sandy and thirsty Soil,
which as well manures as moistens it with the Fat and
pregnant Slime it leaves behind, and, as I said before,
produces both Riches and Health; for the <i>Plague</i>,
which here oftentimes miserably rages, upon the first
Day of the Flood instantly ceases, insomuch, that
whereas 500 had died at <i>Cairo</i> the Day before, on the
Day following there dies not one Man. But if it at any
Time happens that the River does not thus overflow
the Country, then is it commonly the fore-runner of a
following Dearth. Thus, when this River flows but
to 16 Degrees, they fear a Famine, but when it comes
to 23, ’tis a sign of a good Year, whereas when ’tis
too high the Inundation is dangerous. <i>Thevenot</i> says,
If it rises but to 16 Foot, a Famine unavoidably follows
for want of Water; and if it swells to 24, there
will be a Dearth, because the Seed-Time must be lost.
There are besides many other rare Properties belonging
to this River, which to relate would make my Digression
too long, and my intent was only to mention
such Things as chiefly tend to a Natural History,
among which, those curious Observations made by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Father <i>Vansleb</i> are most to my purpose, which therefore
I shall insert as follows:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable <i>Observations</i> on the <i>Nile</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>This is remarkable of</i> Nile, <i>says my Author, That it
begins to increase and decrease on a certain Day, and that
when it first increases, it grows green and afterwards appears
red: The Day on which it begins to increase is
Yearly the</i> 12th <i>of</i> June, <i>according to the</i> Copties <i>Account,
or the</i> 17th <i>according to Ours, when the Natives
observe the Feast of St.</i> Michael <i>the Arch-Angel, on which
Feast the Drops begin to fall: Now these Drops, according
to the Opinion of the Inhabitants, are Tokens of the
Mercies and Blessings of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>. They believe <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>
sends the Arch-Angel, St.</i> Michael, <i>on that Day to cause
the River to be Fruitful; this is the common sentiment the
People have, but the Learned say, these Drops are a kind
of Dew, which falls towards the last quarter of the Night,
near the Morning, and causes the River to be Fertile,
Purifies the Air from all Infection of</i> Camsin, <i>and gives
Strength and Virtue to whatever it falls upon</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cause</i> of its <i>Fertility</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>These Drops are doubtless the sole Cause of the Fertility
of the</i> Nile; <i>for as soon as the Dew is fallen, the Waters
begin to corrupt and turn of a greenish Colour: This Colour
increases more and more till the River appears as a
Lake cover’d all over with Moss; this Colour is to be seen
not only in its great Channel, but also in all the Bounds
and Branches that come from it, the Cisterns only preserving
their Water pure; some Years this green Colour continues
about 20 Days, and sometimes longer, but never
above 40. The</i> Egyptians <i>call this Time</i> il chadraviat,
<i>for then they suffer much, the Water being corrupt
and unwholesome, and because good Water is very scarce.
These Drops or Dew purifie the Air, for so soon as
ever they begin to fall, the</i> Plague <i>ceases to be mortal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>none die of it; the Air becomes wholesome, all Diseases
are disarm’d, and if any Person happens to be sick of it,
he shall be sure not to die. This Dew gives Life to every
Thing, and when it falls on the Wheat, causes it to continue
many Years without Corruption or Worms, nay makes
it far more Nourishing than any Corn on which it has never
come. For this Reason the Natives never house the</i> Grand
Signiors <i>Corn till this Dew be fallen, to the end it may
keep the longer free from Worms</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its <i>Increase</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>The Increase of this River proceeds from several Causes;
the first and chiefest of which, is the Fermentation caused
therein by this Dew, which falls precisely at the Time before-mention’d.
The continual Rains of</i> Æthiopia, <i>that
come in</i> July, August <i>and</i> September, <i>which is the Winter
Quarter of this Country, together with the great Torrents
of Water that rush down from the Mountains, into the Rivers
that flow into the</i> Nile, <i>may be look’d on as another
Cause of its Increase; for I cannot conceive the Fermentation
can last 100 Days, and singly cause it to increase
so much as it is wont. The third Cause are the Westerly
Winds call’d</i> Maestrals, <i>and by the</i> Egyptians Maltem,
<i>which begin about 12 Days before the Dew comes, and
continue about four Months without Cessation; they blow
directly into the</i> Nile, <i>and hinder the fresh Water from
coming out, so that it returns back, which causes the
River to swell. So soon as the green Colour is gone, the
River begins to turn red and very muddy; ’tis then no
doubt the Fermentation is past, and the Waters of</i> Æthiopia
<i>are arriv’d in</i> Egypt, <i>which are of that Colour, by
reason of the red Earth the furious Torrents from the
Mountains carry along with them; for ’tis not probable
the Land of</i> Egypt, <i>which is very black, should give
that Tincture. In the Year</i> 1673, <i>at the beginning of</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>July, <i>the Water began to turn red, which continu’d to the
end of</i> December, <i>the Time the River ordinarily returns
to its usual bigness. The</i> Egyptians <i>have an Art to make
this muddy Water as clear as Cristal; so soon as the Water-Bearers
have fill’d their Vessels, they rub them in the
inside with a Paste made of pounded Almonds, which in
a short Time causes the Water to become very clear. In
such Places where this Paste is not to be had, they use instead
of it the Kernels of Apricocks, pounded after the
same manner, and some say the Flower of little Beans will
have the same Effect.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Operation</i> of its <i>Waters</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>The Waters of this River have several Operations, for</i>,
First, <i>They bring a Loosness on new Comers, in case the
Parties drink them at their first arrival, and it continues
about eight Days</i>. Secondly, <i>They cause an Itching in
the Skin, which troubles those that drink them when the
River increases: This Itch is very small, appearing first
about the Arms, then on the Stomach, and afterwards
spreading all over the Body, which causes grievous Pain.
This Itch comes not only on such as have drunk of the River,
but such as drink out of the Cisterns fill’d with River-Water;
it lasts about six Weeks.</i> Thirdly, <i>About the
Months of</i> June, July, August <i>and</i> September <i>it turns
into Sweat, but is not so in any other Time of the Year</i>.
Fourthly, <i>When this Water covers the Earth, it fattens
the Land with the Slime it leaves behind. Monsieur</i>
Thevenot <i>is mistaken in his Travels into the</i> Levant,
<i>where he says, This Slime makes the Ground so fat, that
if Sand were not mingl’d with it, it would Rot and
Choak whatever is put into it; and that in</i> Egypt <i>they
take as much Pains to carry Sand upon their Land, as we
do to lay Dung. This is not generally so, for they never
use Sand but for Melons, Cucumbers, and such like Fruits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>which grow best in sandy Grounds; they never use it for
other Fruits and Grains.</i> Thus far <i>Vansleb</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their <i>Virtues</i> and <i>Goodness</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Sandys</i>, speaking in Commendation of these Waters,
says, They procure liberal Urine, curing Pains in the
Kidnies, and are a most sovereign Remedy against
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypocondriacus Affectus</span></i>, or Wind-Melancholy.
They are not unpleasantly cold, but of all others the
most sweet and wholsome, by reason of their being
well concocted by the Sun, which at all Times is, in
some part or other, directly over them, and by the
length of their Course, running from <i>South</i> to <i>North</i>,
besides <i>Ambages</i> above 41 Degrees, so that from this
River there ascend no Vapours, the Humour being
rarifi’d by so long a Progress, which tho’ exhal’d, assumes
no visible Body, but undistinguishably mixes
with the pure Air, agreeing with the same in tenuity.
<i>Thevenot</i> speaks much to the same purpose in his Travels
to the <i>Levant</i>, fol. 245. where he says, This Water
is so wholsome, it never does any harm, tho’ drank
to never so great a degree, by reason it comes a great
way over Land, to wit, from <i>Æthiopia</i>, so that in so
long a Course, thro’ so hot a Country, the Sun has
Time to correct and purifie it from all Crudities, and
indeed it is sweated out as fast as one drinks it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Used instead of <i>Drink</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>They have no other Water to drink in <i>Egypt</i>, therefore
most of their Cities, Towns and Villages stand
on the Borders of this River; there are also many
Canals and deep Ponds which have been caus’d to be
cut at convenient Distances, by the Care and Magnificence
of their Kings, for the Refreshment and Use
of the People, who indeed need no other Drink. The
Waters of this River are of such excellent Taste and
Virtue, that when <i>Pescennius Niger</i> heard his Souldiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>murmur for want of Wine, he thus reply’d, <i>What!
crave ye Wine and yet have</i> Nile <i>to drink of?</i> The first
Kings of <i>Egypt</i> made such account of them, that they
almost drank nothing else; and when <i>Ptolomy Philadelphus</i>
marry’d his Daughter <i>Berenice</i> to <i>Antiochus
Theos</i>, King of <i>Assyria</i>, he gave orders that from Time
to Time the Waters of <i>Nile</i> should be carry’d her,
that she might drink no other Liquor. And indeed
all Authors agree these Waters are sweet, healthful and
nourishing, and that they keep a long Time without
corrupting, for being left to settle but a small Season,
they become clean, clear, and so sweet and pleasant,
that they excel all others for smoothness and flavour.
<i>Gabriel Sionata</i> in his Tract <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Moribus Orientalium</span></cite>, p.
27. observes, That the Waters of <i>Nile</i>, being only
kept in Pans three Days, and during that Time expos’d
to the heat of the Sun, turn to a pure white Salt; so
that the Land of <i>Egypt</i> has an inexhaustible supply of
that which is so needful for the Life of Man, and that
at small Expence. Moreover, whatever is here valuable
proceeds from the Munificence of this River,
whose Annual overflow is the only Cause of that wonderful
Fertility of the Soil of this Country, which is

<div class='sidenote'>Fertility of <i>Egypt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>In Times past it was reputed the Granary of the
whole World, insomuch, that it was not thought possible
for the <i>Roman</i> Empire to subsist without its affluence.
Also, after <i>Selimus</i> Emperor of the <i>Turks</i> had
conquer’d this Country, he was heard to say, That
now he had taken a Farm would plentifully feed his
<i>Jemoglans</i>. Monsieur <i>Thevenot</i> says, <i>Egypt</i> may well
be stil’d an Earthly Paradise; for so great is its increase,
that in many Places they reap two considerable Crops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>a Year; Hay they mow four Times, and as for Pease,
Beans, and other Garden-Ware, those grow spontaneously
all the Year round. All kinds of Fruit are exceeding
plentiful, Grapes only excepted, which it may
be Nature keeps back as thinking the Natives of <i>Egypt</i>
can want no Wine, since they have so good Water.
In a Word, <i>Lucan</i> thus characterizes this Country:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Red Sea</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Next we shall speak of the <i>Red Sea</i>, as having been
so very Famous, both for the miraculous Passage of
the <i>Israelites</i> as upon dry Land, and the drowning of
<i>Pharaoh Cenchres</i>, and all his Followers, as likewise
for that thro’ it the Spices of <i>India</i> and <i>Arabia</i> were
first brought to <i>Alexandria</i>, and thence dispers’d by
the <i>Venetians</i> throughout all <i>Europe</i>, <i>Africa</i> and <i>America</i>,
as <cite>Heylin</cite>, p. 852. testifies. The <i>Turks</i> call this
Sea the <i>Gulf</i> of <i>Mecca</i>, and the Ancients nam’d it the
<i>Arabian Gulf</i> or <i>Red Sea</i>, the reason of which last, see
in Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i>’s <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, p. 261 and 262. who
also tells us several Princes have attempted to cut thro’
the <i>Isthmus</i>, or narrow Tract of Land, that parts the
<i>Arabian</i> and <i>Mediterranean Seas</i>, but whose intent was
not immediately to unite those Waters, but to make
a Navigable Channel betwixt the former and the <i>Nile</i>,
the Marks whereof remain to this Day. This was
first attempted by <i>Sesostris</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, and afterwards
by <i>Darius</i> King of <i>Persia</i>, but, for fear of drowning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the Country, at length relinquish’d by them both;
yet the same Thing was long after re-attempted, and
in some measure effected by <i>Ptolomy Philadelphus</i>.
Now the <i>Grand Signior</i>, who is Lord of all this Country,
conveys his Gallies into the <i>Red Sea</i> by the <i>Nile</i>;
for bringing them down to <i>Grand Cairo</i>, they are
there taken to pieces, carry’d upon Camels Backs, and
afterwards put together again at <i>Sues</i>, his Port and
Naval Station for that Sea, whereby he in effect puts
the Design of <i>Cleopatra</i> in execution, who after the
Battle at <i>Actium</i>, in a different manner, would have
convey’d her Gallies into the <i>Red Sea</i>. Here, as the
same Author affirms, Coral grows in great abundance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Lake</i> of <i>Mœris</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>As concerning the Lakes of <i>Egypt</i>, that of King
<i>Mœris</i> is not only the most admirable, but likewise the
largest of all, denominated after his own Name, as is
testify’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite>, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> and <i>Pliny</i>; a
Work the most useful and wonderful, says <i>Greaves</i> in
his <cite>Pyramidographia</cite>, p. 11. if rightly consider’d, that
ever was attempted by Man. In the midst of this
Lake that King erected two <i>Pyramids</i>, one in Memory
of himself, and the other of his Wife, each being
600 Feet in height. The Description of both these and
of this Lake we have in <cite>Herodotus</cite>; the latter we find
also in <i>Strabo</i>, but no where so fully as in <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i>, Lib. 1. therefore I shall relate his Words: <i>Ten
Schænes</i> (600 Furlongs, tho’ <i>Strabo</i> and <i>Artemidorus</i>
before him observe a difference of <i>Schænes</i> in <i>Egypt</i>)
<i>above the City</i> Memphis, Mœris <i>dug a Lake of admirable
Use, the Greatness of which is incredible, the Circumference
of it being said to be 3600 Furlongs, and the
Depth in many Places 50 Fathom (200 Cubits or 300
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Feet.) Now who that shall seriously consider the vastness
of this Work, can forbear asking how many Myriads of
Men were employ’d on it, and in how many Years they accomplish’d
it? The common Benefit of this Undertaking
to those that inhabit</i> Egypt, <i>as also the Wisdom of its
Royal Contriver, no Man can sufficiently admire; for since
the increase of</i> Nile <i>is not always the same, and that the
Country is ever made more Fertile by its moderate Rise, this
King contriv’d a Lake to receive the superfluity of the
Water, that neither the greatness of the Inundation unseasonably
drowning the Country, might occasion Marshes
or Lakes, nor the Rivers flowing less than required, corrupt
the Fruits for want of Water. This Prince therefore
caus’d a Ditch to be cut from the River</i> Nile <i>to this Lake,
80 Furlongs long and 300 Feet broad, by which, sometimes
receiving in, and sometimes letting out the Water, he exhibited
a seasonable quantity thereof to the Husbandmen,
the mouth of this Ditch being sometimes open’d and sometimes
shut, yet both not without much Art and great Expence,
for he that would either open the</i> Sluces <i>or shut
them, was under a necessity of expending at least 50 Talents.
This Lake, thus benefiting the</i> Egyptians, <i>has
continu’d even to our Times, and from its Author is at this
Day call’d</i>, The Lake of <i>Mœris. He left a dry place
in the midst, on which he built a</i> Sepulcher <i>and two</i> Pyramids,
<i>each a Furlong high; one of these he made for
himself, and the other for his Wife, placing on each a
Marble Statue sitting on a Throne, imagining that by
these Works he should transmit to Posterity an indelible
Remembrance of his Worth. The Revenue arising from
the Fish of this Lake he gave to his Wife for her Unguents
and other Ornaments, which is said to have been not less
worth to her than a Talent a Day; for according to common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>report there are 22 sorts of Fish in it, which are taken
in such huge quantities, that those who are perpetually
employ’d in salting them, of which there is a very large
number, can hardly dispatch the Work.</i> Thus far <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i>, whose Description of this Lake, as it is
much fuller than that of <cite>Herodotus</cite>, so <cite>Herodotus</cite>, Lib.
2. has this memorable Observation which <i>Diodorus</i>
omitted. <i>He says this Lake was made by Hand, as is
apparent, because almost in the midst of it there stand
two</i> Pyramids, <i>50 Fathoms above Water and as many
under: On each of these there is a</i> Colossus <i>of Stone,
sitting on a Throne; so that by this means, these</i> Pyramids
<i>must in all be 100 Fathoms high</i>. <i>Strabo</i> likewise,
<i>Lib.</i> 17. says, <i>This Lake is wonderful, being like a
Sea both for largeness and Colour</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Dead Sea</i> or <i>Lake Asphaltites</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>But now I am speaking of Seas and Lakes I will
mention one more, which tho’ not in <i>Egypt</i> but in
<i>Palestine</i>, is not yet above 2 <i>Italian</i> Miles off <i>Damiata</i>,
as <cite>Le Bruyn</cite>, p. 138. assures us. This Lake is very beneficial
as well to the <i>Holy Land</i>, in that it plentifully
furnishes that Country with Salt, as to <i>Egypt</i>, by reason
of its large store of Bituminous Matter, of great
use in <i>Embalming</i>: By some it is call’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mare Mortuum</span></i>,
and by others the <i>Lake Asphaltites</i>. The Name of
this Sea is suppos’d to have been given it from its
largeness and saltness, being 70 Miles long and 16
broad, and so extream salt, that its Water burns like
Fire when tasted, and boils up weighty Bodies, insomuch
that whatever living Creature is thrown into it,
sinks not easily. It is call’d the <i>Dead Sea</i>, perhaps
from its heavy Waters hardly to be mov’d by the
Winds, or else because it has no visible efflux into the
Ocean, nor is at all increas’d by the River <i>Jordan</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>many other Waters that flow into it, or <i>Thirdly</i>, In
that no living Creature can breath in it, but is on the
contrary suffocated by its Bituminous Steams, the
great abundance whereof also occasions it to be
call’d <i>Lacus Asphaltites</i>. Now of this <i>Asphaltum</i> or
<i>Bitumen</i> there are several Camel-Loads taken out of it
Dayly, as <i>Thevenot</i> assures us, which raise a very great
Revenue. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> moreover tells us, there
rise such large pieces of <i>Bitumen</i> out of the<a id='t144'></a> midst
this Lake, as are 2 or 300 Feet square; the greater
sort the Inhabitants term Bulls, and the lesser Calves,
which, swimming on the surface of the Water, appear
at a distance like so many Islands. The Time of
the Lakes throwing up this <i>Bitumen</i>, which is Yearly,
may be perceiv’d above 20 Days before it comes; for
everywhere round, for many Furlongs, a Steam arises
with great stench, which changes the natural Colour
of all Gold, Silver or Brass near it, till it be again
exhal’d; and inasmuch as all adjoyning Parts are thus
corrupted with the heat and stench of this Lake, the
Inhabitants are commonly infected with Diseases, and
their Lives thereby shortn’d. This was once a fruitful
Valley, compar’d for delightfulness with Paradise, and
call’d <i>Pentapolis</i> from its five Cities; but which being
destroy’d by Fire from Heaven, it was thereupon
converted into this filthy Lake and barren Desolation
which surrounds it, a fearful Monument of Divine
Wrath, for the Wickedness of <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrha</i>,
two of these five Cities, from the former of which it is
also call’d the <i>Lake</i> of <i>Sodom</i>. But I make mention of
this Lake chiefly for the sake of its <i>Asphaltum</i>, so much
us’d in the <i>Embalmings</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>, and not that
its stench can any ways incommode or prove unhealthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to <i>Egypt</i>; for that Country has neither Seas
Lakes nor Rivers less prejudicial or more beneficial
than the <i>Nile</i>, a River sufficient of it self to water the
Country, fertilize its Soil, and thereby render its Inhabitants
both chearful and healthy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Climate of <i>Egypt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Another Thing to be consider’d, as very useful in
the <i>Natural History</i> of <i>Embalming</i>, is the Climate of
<i>Egypt</i>, whether hot or cold, dry or moist, or compriz’d
under other general Heads, such as those of the <i>Heavens</i>,
<i>Air</i>, <i>Water</i>, <i>Earth</i>, <i>Winds</i>, <i>Seasons</i>, &amp;c. which Qualities,
as they are in great measure occasion’d by the
<i>Nile</i>, so are they also best explain’d by setting forth
those of that River, with their Effects; for <i>Egypt</i> by
reason of its Southerly Situation is very hot, and during
the whole Summer almost insupportable, which
being farther increas’d by the reflexion of the Sun on
its sandy Soil, renders the Air so exceedingly warm
that one can hardly breath in it, which is indeed one
of the greatest Inconveniencies <i>Egypt</i> lies under. This
heat unavoidably dries up all the Rivers for near six
Months together, so that the People must of necessity
die with Famine, did not the <i>Nile</i> overflow and fill
up their empty Channels, thereby relieving them,
thirsty as their Soil. Now the Property of this River
is the more remarkable, in that it differs from those of
all others, which are only full in Winter; whereas,
on the contrary, this overflows in Summer, when
there is most occasion for it, as if purposely design’d by
Providence to save a famish’d and scorch’d Country.
Moreover this is worth taking notice of, that the Soil
of <i>Egypt</i> being naturally Sandy and Steril, and withal
very dry and scorch’d, is by means of the overflowing
of <i>Nile</i> sufficiently water’d, and by the fat Mud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>it leaves behind made very Fertile and fit for Tillage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Air</i> very hot.</div>

<p class='c009'>The Air also of this Country, especially about <i>Cairo</i>,
and farther towards the <i>South</i>, because so near the
Line, is extream hot, for there, says <i>Ogilby</i> in his Description
of <cite>Egypt</cite>, p. 115. the Sun casts its Beams perpendicularly
from <i>Cancer</i>, during which Time of violent
Heat the People are wont to dwell in Caverns; nay in
<i>Cairo</i>, in the midst of every House, there are Wells
with Water in them, which not only cool the Mansions
but refresh their Inhabitants: They have likewise
contriv’d large Pipes or Funnels in the midst of their
Houses, which standing right up into the Air, with
broad Mouths like Bells, and lying open to the <i>North</i>,
receive the cool Air, which is thereby sent down into
the lowermost Rooms. For shade also in the Streets,
every Dwelling has a broad Penthouse; and for further
refreshment the Inhabitants use Bathing, having
curious Bagnio’s of fresh and clear Water from the
River <i>Nile</i>, without any mixture either of Herbs or
medicinal Ingredients.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cool’d by the <i>Nile</i> and Annual <i>Winds</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The Heat of this Country is moreover somewhat
moderated by the overflowing of <i>Nile</i>, and the continual
blowing of cool Northerly Winds, otherwise it
would be so vehement, neither Man nor Beast could
be able to breath in it. In Winter the Air is <i>hot</i> and
<i>dry</i>, tho’ sometimes a little <i>cool</i>, yet generally extream
hot, and more prejudicial to the Head than any other
part of the Body. <i>Sandys</i> says, p. 76. It is as hot
with them in the depth of <i>Winter</i>, as with us in the
midst of <i>July</i>. The Air a Nights is cool, which after
Sun-rising becomes a little warm, at Noon very hot,
but at Night returns to be cold again, so that its
inequality breeds many Diseases; nevertheless, in as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>much as it is exceeding Serene, being constantly free
both from Rain, Clouds, Mists, Fogs, Hail, Snow, <i>&amp;c.</i>
which rarely happen, it is accounted very healthful;
and in this Sense we must take <cite>Herodotus</cite> Lib. 2. where
he says, <i>The</i> Egyptians <i>are the Healthiest People of the
World, by reason of the immutability of their Air</i>. But
that it Rains, Hails and Snows sometimes in that
Country, tho’ many of the Ancients deny it, is plainly
confirm’d by several modern Writers, wherefore
Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i> places that assertion among his Vulgar
Errors, and <i>p.</i> 260 thus confutes it. <i>’Tis confirm’d</i>,
says he, <i>by many, and believ’d by most, that it never
Rains in</i> Egypt, <i>the River</i> Nile <i>plentifully supplying that
Defect, and bountifully requiting it by its Inundation;
yet this must be understood in a qualify’d Sense, that is, that
it Rains there but seldom in Summer, and very rarely in
Winter</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rain in <i>Egypt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But that great Showers do sometimes fall on
this Region, besides the Assertion of many Writers, is
confirm’d by the Honourable and Occular Testimony
of Sir <i>William Paston</i>, Bar<sup>t.</sup> who affirms, That not many
Years since it rain’d in <i>Grand Cairo</i> for divers Days together.
The same is likewise attested as to other parts
of <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Prosper Alpinus</i>, who liv’d long in that
Country, and has left us an accurate Treatise of the
Medicinal Practice there: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cairi, raro decidunt Pluviæ,
Alexandriæ, Pelusiiq; &amp; in omnibus Locis Mari adjacentibus,
pluit largissime &amp; sæpe</span></i>. That is, <i>It Rains seldom
at</i> Cairo, <i>but at</i> Alexandria, Damiata, <i>and other Places
near the Sea, very often and plentifully</i>. The same
likewise is to be inferr’d from this Author concerning
Snow, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rarissime Nix, Grando</span></i>, &amp;c. <i>It seldom either Snows
or Hails, wherefore we cannot deny Snow or Hail never
to fall because they happen but seldom.</i> The rarity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of them however may be the occasion of that Saying
of <i>Horace</i>, Lib, 3. Ode 26.</p>

<p class='c009'>To all this may be added the Testimony of the Learn’d
Mr. <i>Greaves</i>, whose Words, as you may find them, <i>p.</i>
74, 75. of his accurate Description of the <i>Pyramids</i>,
I will here insert, by reason they not only prove these
Rains, but likewise impart some curious Observations
on the Air of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Nile</i>. <i>I cannot</i>, says he, <i>sufficiently
wonder at the Ancients who generally deny’d the
fall of Rains in</i> Egypt. <i>Plato</i> in his <i>Timæus</i> speaking
of this Country, where he had liv’d many Years, writes
thus, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κατὰ δὲ τὴν δὲ τὴν χώραν οὔτε τότε, οὔτε
ἄλλοτε, ἄνωθεν ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρούρας ὕδωρ ἐπιῤῥεῖ</span><a id='t148'></a>. <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> But in that Country no Rain
falls on the Ground at any Time. <i>Pomponius Mela</i> in
express Terms relates, <i>That</i> Egypt <i>is</i> Terra expers Imbrium,
miré tamen fertilis; <i>whereas for two Months</i>, viz.
December <i>and</i> January, <i>I have not known it Rain so
constantly, and with so great impetuosity at</i> London, <i>as
I found it to do at</i> Alexandria, <i>the Winds continuing</i> N.
N. W. <i>which caus’d me to keep a Diary, as well of the
Weather as of my Observations in Astronomy, and that not
only there, but also at</i> Grand Cairo. <i>My very noble and
worthy Friend, Sir</i> William Paston, <i>observ’d at the same
Time that there fell much Rain; so likewise about the end
of</i> March <i>following, being at the</i> Mummies <i>somewhat
beyond the</i> Pyramids <i>towards the</i> South, <i>there fell a gentle
shower of Rain for almost an whole Day together: But it
may be the Ancients meant the upper part of</i> Egypt, <i>beyond</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Thebes, <i>about</i> Siene, <i>and near the</i> Catadupæ <i>or</i> Cataracts
<i>of</i> Nile <i>and not the lower Parts; for there indeed I
have been told by the</i> Egyptians <i>it seldom Rains, wherefore</i>
Seneca <i>Lib.</i> 4. Natur. Quæst. <i>may have written true,
where he says</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Snow in <i>Egypt</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In ea parte quæ in Æthiopiam vergit</span>,
<i>speaking of</i> Egypt, aut nulli Imbres sunt aut rari. <i>But
where he says</i>, Alexandriæ Nives non cadunt, <i>’tis false;
for at my being there in</i> January <i>it snow’d one whole
Night. However, farther towards the</i> South <i>than</i> Egypt,
<i>between the</i> Tropicks, <i>and near the</i> Line, <i>in the Country
of</i> Abyssinia <i>or</i> Æthiopia, <i>there falls every Year, for many
Weeks together, store of Rain, as the</i> Abyssins <i>themselves
have related at</i> Grand Cairo, <i>which may likewise be confirm’d
by</i> Josephus Acosta, <i>Lib.</i> 1. De naturâ Orbis novi,
<i>where he observes, that in</i> Peru <i>and some other Places, lying
in the same Paralel with</i> Æthiopia, <i>they have abundance
of Rain.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cause of the Inundation of <i>Nile</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This then is the true Cause of the Inundation
of</i> Nile <i>in the Summer-Time, it being then highest
when other Rivers are lowest, and not those which are
alledg’d by</i> Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch,
Aristides, Heliodorus <i>and others, who are all extreamly
troubl’d to give a Reason for the Inundation of this River,
imputing it either to the peculiar Nature of its Water,
the obstruction of it by the</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Etesiæ</span>, <i>or else to the melting
of the Snows in</i> Æthiopia, <i>which however I verily believe
rarely fall in those hot Countries, where the Natives, by
reason of the extream Heats, are all Black, and where, if
we credit</i> Seneca, Argentum replumbatur, <i>Silver is
melted by the scorching Climate, or in a word, to some
other such like Reasons of small weight. In</i> Diodorus
Siculus <i>I find</i> Agatharcides Cnidius <i>giving almost the
same Reason I have done, whose Assertion however those
Times gave but little credit to, yet does</i> Diodorus <i>seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>to agree with it in these words</i>, Lib. 1. <cite>Agatharcides Cnidius</cite>
has come nearest the Truth, he affirming that
every Year, in the Mountains about <i>Æthiopia</i>, there
are continual Rains from the Summer Solstice to the
Autumnal Equinox, which cause this Inundation of
<i>Nile</i>. <i>The Time of this is so certain, that I have known
the</i> Egyptian <i>Astronomers put down many Years before in
their</i> Ephemerides, That such a Day of such a Month
the <i>Nile</i> will begin to rise. Thus far <i>Greaves</i>, to
which I may add an Experiment of the Lord <i>Bacon</i>’s
concerning the scarcity of Rain in <i>Egypt</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>An <i>Experiment</i>
concerning
the scarcity
of <i>Rain</i> in
<i>Egypt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>’Tis strange</i>,
says he, <i>p.</i> 161. <i>of his</i> Natural History, <i>the River</i> Nile
<i>overflowing as it does the Country of</i> Egypt, <i>there should
nevertheless be little or no Rain known in that Country.
The Cause must lye either in the Nature of the</i> Water,
<i>the</i> Air, <i>or of both. As for the</i> Water, <i>it may</i>, First, <i>be
ascrib’d to its long Course; for swift running Waters vapour
less than those that are standing, as those that have
been sometimes boyling on the Fire, do not cast so great a
steam as they did at first: Now ’tis certain the Waters of</i>
Nile <i>are sweeter than others in taste, and excellent good
against the</i> Stone <i>and</i> Hypocondriacal Melancholy,
<i>which shews they are</i> Lenifying. Secondly, <i>The Reason
of this Inundation may be, that these Waters running
thro’ a Country of a hot</i> Climate <i>and flat, without shade
either from Woods or Hills, the</i> Sun <i>must thereby necessarily
have greater power to concoct them. As for the</i> Air,
<i>whence I conceive this want of Showers chiefly comes, the
Cause must be, that the</i> Air <i>of it self is thin and thirsty,
and therefore so soon as ever it gets any moisture from the</i>
Water, <i>it imbibes and disperses it throughout its whole
Body, not suffering it to remain in a</i> Vapour <i>whereby it
might breed</i> Rain. Now tho’ it is not to be deny’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>that Rains fall sometimes in <i>Egypt</i>, yet this may however
be averr’d, that they happen but seldom, therefore
the Air must consequently be more settl’d than
ours and freer from Vapours, Fogs, or the like, which
renders it not only healthful, but very beneficial in
preserving and <i>Embalming</i> Bodies, they being by nothing
so much damnify’d as by uncertain Weather,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Moist <i>Air</i> prejudicial to <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of
which we have too sad Experience in this our moist
Climate. We are therefore forc’d to supply the want
of this, either by a total exclusion of the Air by <i>Air-Pumps</i>,
by immerging our dead Bodies into Spirituous
or Balsamic Liquors, or else by driving away all
Damps and Moistures by moderate Fires. This every
one knows who has been us’d either to Confectionery,
preserving natural Curiosities, or the like, to whom
the giving, relaxing or molding Things, serves as a
<i>Thermometer</i> whereby to distinguish the several changes
and varieties of the Weather.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Egypt</i> has not only an advantage of other Countries
by the goodness of its <i>Water</i>, serenity of its <i>Air</i>,
and warmth of its <i>Climate</i>, but also derives a yet farther
Benefit in regard of <i>Embalming</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sand</i> how useful in <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from the Nature
of its <i>Sand</i> and <i>Soil</i>, the usefulness of which has in
this respect been sufficiently experienc’d by Modern
Artists. Thus it is reported curious Florists preserve
both the form and colours of beauteous Plants, by
laying them in Sand, drying them in an Oven, or the
like; and thus some modern <i>Embalmers</i> have, by hot
Sand laid on prepar’d Bodies, dry’d up the superfluous
Moisture, and reduc’d their <i>Embalming</i> Matter to a
just Consistency: ’Tis likewise observable some Sands
will naturally <i>Embalm</i> without any addition of Balsamic
Ingredients. Moreover, ’tis probable the Sea-Sands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>may have the like Effect, provided they be not
too often wet; for thus a Body being first pickl’d or
salted, as it were with the Sea-Brine, may afterwards,
when dry’d by the Wind or Sun, remain firm and
durable as long as it shall be preserv’d free from Wet
or Moisture; and partly of this Opinion perhaps was
Mr. <i>William Glanvill</i> of the <i>Temple</i>, who having so
order’d it in his Will, was bury’d in the <i>Goodwin-Sands</i>,
which tho’ they cannot preserve him, as before alledg’d,
because so often wet, yet he being inclos’d in a leaden
Coffin, that must in Time sink to the bottom, they
may by their coolness help to keep his Corps entire
for many Years; or at least by being so secur’d, he
will be defended from the rapine of Animals, or disturbances
of Sextons: But the Sands of <i>Egypt</i> being
much more hot, from the reflection of the scorching
Sun, are capable of Preserving Bodies without either
Salination or <i>Embalming</i>, and that only by exhaling
and drying up the Humidities and adventitious Moisture,
insomuch that it has occasion’d no small Contests
among some Authors, which of the two is the
truer Mummy, that dry’d in the <i>Sands</i>, or that which
is <i>Embalm’d</i> with Balsams and Aromatics. <i>Le Fevre</i> in
his <cite>Chymistry</cite>, p. 138. is entirely of the first Opinion;
but I shall refer such Disputes to their proper Places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mummies</i> found in the <i>Sands</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Of those sorts of <i>Mummies</i> there have been many
casually found in the Desarts of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Lybia</i>, <i>Arabia</i>,
&amp;c. suppos’d to have been Travellers suffocated by
great drifts of Sand, rais’d by sudden Tempests; for
it sometimes so happens, that contrary Winds arising
of a sudden, agitate the Sands with such impetuosity,
that they over-whelm Passengers and Beasts with their
Burthens, who perishing thus unawares, are thro’ the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>power of the hot Sun and parching Sand so dry’d,
they become fix’d and for ever undissolvable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Drying Quality</i> of the <i>Earth</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Next as to the Medicinal Virtue of the Soil of <i>Egypt</i>,
and how far it may be serviceable in <i>Embalming</i> and
preserving Bodies, every one, who does but consider
its great Stipticity and drying Nature, will be very
well satisfy’d: Besides this Earth is never much dampt
by Rains or Springs, but kept constantly dry by the
warmth of the Sun. <i>Aetius</i> and <i>Galen</i> commend it
as good against <i>Phlegmons</i>, <i>Oedematous</i> Tumors, and
immoderate Fluxes of the <i>Hæmorhoids</i>; also that it
cures Dropsies meerly by anointing with it, of which
see more in <cite>Olaus Borrichius</cite>, p. 146. Thus having
consider’d the <i>Water</i>, <i>Air</i> and <i>Earth</i> of <i>Egypt</i>, I will
next add some Observations of Father <i>Vansleb</i> on the
Seasons of the Egyptian Year, with their Computation
of Time, calculated according to the Account of the
<i>Copties</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Seasons</i> of the <i>Year</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Egyptians</i> reckon their <i>Autumn</i> from the 15th
of <i>September</i> to the 15th of <i>December</i>. <i>Winter</i> begins
with them the 15th of <i>December</i>, and ends the 15th of
<i>March</i>. <i>Spring</i> begins the 15th of <i>March</i>, and ends
the 15th of <i>June</i>. <i>Summer</i> begins the 15th of <i>June</i>,
and ends the 15th of <i>September</i>. They allot every
<i>Season</i> just Three Months, and begin their Year in
<i>September</i>, as I observ’d before. Every Month has
Thirty Days, which in Twelve Months make Three
hundred and sixty Days; but because there yet want
Five to complete the Year, they add those at the end
of all, and call them <i>Epagomene</i>, which signifies <i>added</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Temperate Season.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The most temperate Season, has still somewhat of
<i>Spring</i> or <i>Autumn</i> in it, which two last cannot well be
distinguish’d in <i>Egypt</i>. Now the mild Weather commences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>in <i>September</i>, then they begin to breath the fresh
Air, but, as about this Time, the Fields are all so cover’d
with Water, one cannot Walk nor Travel by
Land; an Abode there is not pleasant till the middle
of <i>November</i>, for then the Country’s dry, the Ways
free, the Waters run into their Channels, the Air pleasant,
the heat of the Sun supportable, the Fields green
and sweet, and refreshing Gales blow every-where. In
short, the Season is then very comfortable, and so continues
’till the middle of <i>April</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cold Season.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The cold Season, answerable to our <i>Winter</i>, begins
about the middle of <i>December</i>. It is a delightful Time,
unless in those seven Days which the <i>Arabians</i> term,
<i>Berd il agiuz</i>, (<i>the cold of the old Hag</i>.) They begin
about the 7th of <i>February</i>, and continue to the 14th.
The Mornings are then exceeding cold, the Sky cloudy,
Rains fall, and the Winds are continually boisterous.
Now tho’ Winter be in this Country extream mild,
yet do Persons of Quality always wear furr’d Gowns
from the Month of <i>November</i> to that of <i>March</i>, not
on account of any great cold, for there is hardly any
at this Time; but because the Weather is then more
variable, and the <i>Egyptians</i> fear to be incommoded by
Distempers, which such a changeable Time occasions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Intemperate Season.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Summer</i> is the worst and most troublesome Season,
by reason of the excessive heat of the hot Winds, and
the perilous Diseases that are rife about this Time,
which the <i>Egyptians</i> term <i>Camsins</i>, and we <i>Easter</i>: This
dangerous Season begins about the <i>Easter</i>-Monday of
the <i>Copties</i>, and ends with their <i>Whitson</i>-Monday.
About this Time the Winds, the <i>Arabians</i> term <i>Merissi</i>,
are boisterous; they are so hot and troublesome, People
are ready to be stifl’d by them, and raise in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Air so much Straw and Sand, the Sky is almost darkned
with it: This Sand is so subtile, it penetrates every
little chink and cranny. About this Time <i>Malignant
Fevers</i>, <i>Dysenterys</i>, and many other Diseases commonly
reign, the least of which is incurable if not resisted
by necessary Remedies timely apply’d; nay, when these
Winds blow, Bodies that were healthy before, will
sicken and grow out of order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Winds</i> which blow most in <i>Egypt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>These Southerly Winds blow not every Day in this
Season, nor every Year in the same manner, or with
a like impetuosity. ’Tis not possible to express the
Peoples Joy when they favour them by becoming mild.
Besides the two chief Winds which blow in <i>Egypt</i>, viz.
<i>Merissi</i> and <i>Maltem</i>, I must farther take notice, that
not only the Southern Winds are term’d <i>Merissi</i>, but
also the Eastern. These blow commonly twice every
Year, at <i>Easter</i>, call’d, as I have already said, <i>Camsin</i>,
and from the Month of <i>November</i> to the middle of
<i>February</i>. The Winds call’d <i>Maltem</i> or <i>Teijah</i> are
Westerly ones; they begin about Twelve Days before
the Rains fall, and last ’till the Month of <i>November</i>,
during which Time scarce any other Wind blows. The
Winds <i>Merissi</i> are hot and spoil the Corn, whereas
these nourish and refresh it, and not only so, but prove
comfortable both to Man and Beast, since they are
cooling and afford strength.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rains</i> or <i>Mists</i> of <i>Egypt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The ordinary Time for <i>Rains</i> and <i>Winds</i>, which
might be compar’d to our <i>Autumn</i>, begins in the
Month of <i>December</i>, and lasts ’till <i>January</i> or <i>February</i>,
tho’ at <i>Rosetta</i> and <i>Alexandria</i> the Rains fall at other
Times, by reason of the propinquity of the Sea, nay
sometimes it happens to be misty and moist at a Season
when none expect it, which often proves so considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>as to wet ones Cloaths, as much as a shower of Rain:
But these moist Mists are more frequent about <i>Cairo</i>
than any where else. They usually begin about <i>November</i>,
before the rising of the Sun, and continue all
<i>Winter</i>. Some happen in other Seasons, and many
times in <i>Summer</i>, as <i>Vansleb</i> observ’d in the Year 1672.
at the beginning of <i>August</i>, when returning back from
<i>Fium</i> to <i>Mocanan</i>, a Village about Four Hours from
<i>Cairo</i>, he saw over that City so thick a Mist, he could
neither see the Buildings there, nor the <i>Pyramids</i> that
are near, tho’ the Air was clear where he stood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dew</i> of <i>Egypt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Throughout all the Seasons of the Year, when the
Nights are serene, so much Dew falls it may well be
taken for a moderate Shower, whereas when ever the
Sky is cloudy no Dew must be expected. Were it not
for these Dews, there would neither be Grass nor Corn
in <i>Egypt</i>; the Trees would bear no Fruit, nor could
the wild Beasts in the Desarts live, here being neither
Fountains nor Rivers, and the Rains falling but seldom.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Thunder</i> seldom heard.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Thunder</i> is rarely heard, for in all the Time <i>Vansleb</i> liv’d
in <i>Egypt</i>, he says, he heard that noise but twice, <i>viz.</i>
on the First of <i>January</i> and the Fourth of <i>May</i>, 1673.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Seasons</i> why to be observ’d in <i>Embalming</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>These Things are to be regarded the more particularly,
in that the temperature of Seasons conduces
much to the preservation of Bodies, which is so far
to be consider’d, as it acquaints us when is the best
and most proper Time for Pickling, Preserving or
<i>Embalming</i> Bodies; what Time of the Year, Day or
Moon is best for gathering Fruits, Flowers, Plants, <i>&amp;c.</i>
in order to the well preserving and laying them up,
as also what Places are fittest for Repositories for them
after they are gather’d and prepar’d; for there are
some, both Places and Airs, where Sweet-Meats will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>give and dissolve, bak’d Meats, Pyes, <i>&amp;c.</i> gather mould,
Liquors mother, and Flesh or Fish corrupt sooner than
in others, wherefore such Places are to be avoided as
exceeding prejudicial to <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, in as much
as they will dispose what is not preserv’d, to Putrifaction,
and what is, to Relaxation. For this Reason my
Lord <i>Bacon</i> advises us well, to be very careful in our
choice of Places for this purpose, and to the end the
aptness or propensity either of the Air or Water, to
corrupt or putrifie, may be easier found out, proposes
the following Experiments:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Experiments</i> of the <i>Air</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>First</i>, To lay Wool,
Sponge or a piece of Bread in a Place one would make
Tryal of, and then to observe whether it be wetter or
more ponderous than the same was when laid in other
Places, by which one may judge whether the Place
design’d be in a moist or gross Air. <i>Secondly</i>, To expose
raw Flesh or Fish to the open Air, or lay them
on the Earth, when if they quickly corrupt, ’tis a sign
of a disposition in that Air to Putrifaction. <i>Thirdly</i>,
The quick Putrifaction of Waters or Dews may likewise
disclose the Qualities of the Air and Vapours of
the Earth more or less corrupt: ’Tis good also to
make Trial not only of the moisture and dryness of
the Air, but of the Temper thereof in heat or cold;
for that may concern Health variously, and whatever
in this respect conduces thereto, the same is to be observ’d
in <i>Embalming</i>. <i>Fourthly</i>, The goodness of Airs
is likewise to be known by placing two Weather-Glasses
in several Places, where no shades or inclosures
are, and then remarking their difference, and the like.
Now these sorts of Experiments serve for a natural
Divination of Seasons, shewing them much better
than any Astronomers can do by their Figures. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>also inform us of the wholsomness or unwholsomness
of Dwelling-Places, and where to erect Granaries for
Corn, Store-Houses for Fruits, Green-Houses for Plants,
Vaults for Wine, and Conservatories for other Things
which require keeping either hot, or cold and dry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the <i>Water</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Next as to Waters, this may serve for one Trial of
their goodness, <i>viz.</i> To observe which will keep sweet
the longest, for such likewise denote the Healthfulness
of any Place: Now, how far the goodness of Waters
tend to the preservation of Bodies and Things, may
well enough be observ’d from Brewing, Washing, Baking,
and the like; for those that make the strongest
Drink, are ever the best concocted and most nourishing;
those that bear Soap well, fret not out Cloaths
like those that are hungry, but are fat, smooth and
soft in Taste, which is also allow’d to be a general sign
of good Water; so likewise such as are lightest and
most apt quickly to boil away, are always best. Now
these are the most useful in making Bread, Pyes, <i>&amp;c.</i>
and will keep them longest without moulding; but
of all <i>European</i>-Waters that of the River <i>Thames</i> is the
most noted for making Sea-Beer and Bisket, which are
carry’d the longest Voyages, and into the hottest
Countries of both <i>East</i> and <i>West-Indies</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Air</i> and <i>Water</i> of <i>Egypt</i> very good.</div>

<p class='c009'>By these Considerations on the Air and Water, we
may see the great advantage <i>Egypt</i> receiv’d from the
clearness and dryness of the one, and sweetness and
softness of the other, to which <cite>Herodotus</cite> chiefly attributes
the Health and long Life of those People, as
we, in some measure, may the continuance and duration
of their <i>Embalmings</i>; for, as inequality of Air
is pernicious to Health, so it is also to <i>Embalming</i>,
therefore we find the Winter-Seasons are not so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>proper for this Art as the Summer, as producing
much Rain, with misty or foggy Weather, which
disposes all things to Putrifaction, in so much that
Flesh is then hardly to be kept from being musty or
stinking, by reason it will not so well take Salt at that
Time. Things preserv’d with Sugar relax, and dry’d
Things, imbibing the moisture, either rot or mould,
which Mouldiness is a beginning of Putrifaction, that
afterwards turns to Worms or odious Stinks.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Inequality of <i>Air</i> bad for <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now
as inequality of Air produces Putrifaction, so does also
an interchangeableness of heat and cold, wet and
dry, as may be observ’d from the mouldring of Earth
in Frost and the Sun, or in the more hasty rotting of
Wood that is sometimes wet and sometimes dry; so
likewise a certain degree of heat or cold preserves and
keeps Bodies from Putrifaction, whereas a tepid heat
inclines them to it; for, tho’ such a weak degree
of heat may put the Spirits in a little motion, yet is it
not able to digest the Parts, or rarifie them, as may
be seen by Flesh kept in a Room that is not cool,
whereas in a cold and wet Larder ’twill keep much
longer, and we observe that Vivification, as the Lord
<i>Bacon</i> says in his <cite>Nat. Hist.</cite> p. 74. (whereof Putrifaction
is the bastard Brother) is effected by such soft
Heats, as the hatching of Eggs, commonly practis’d
at <i>Cairo</i>, the heat of the Womb, <i>&amp;c.</i> whereas such a
heat as breaths forth adventitious Moisture best preserves
Bodies; for as wetting hastens Corruption, so
convenient drying (whereby the more radical Moisture
is only kept in) puts back Putrifaction: So we
may also observe that Herbs and Flowers, when dry’d
in the shade or hot Sun, for a small space keep best.
For these Reasons the warm Climate of <i>Egypt</i> must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>needs conduce best to the preservation of Things and
<i>Embalming</i> Bodies, provided it be not attempted in
the extream heat of the Summer, which is between
<i>Easter</i> and <i>Whitsontide</i>, at which Time the hot Southerly
Winds blow, which bring malignant Fevers, Plagues
and great Putrifactions. Thus much as to the temperature
of the Air shall suffice; next we must speak of
the <i>Egyptians</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The antient <i>Egyptians</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The antient and true <i>Egyptians</i> were the <i>Copties</i> or
<i>Copts</i>, so call’d, as I have formerly shown, p. 126. from
<i>Coptus</i>, Son of <i>Misraim</i>, who became King of <i>Egypt</i>
upon the Decease of his Father, and his Conquest over
his Brothers; for those who now inhabit that Country,
according to <i>Sandys</i>, <i>Heylin</i> and others,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Character</i> of the modern <i>Egyptians</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
are much
degenerate from the Ingenuity and Worth of their
Ancestors, being not only Ignorant but Barbarous, devoted
to Luxury and Venery, and naturally addicted
to detract from what is Good and Eminent, nay, in a
word, they are both Cowardly and Cruel. In their
Dealings they are more Observant than Faithful; of a
Genius much inclin’d to Craftiness, and very eager of
Profit. Such as inhabit the Cities apply themselves
to Merchandize, grow Rich by Trading, are reasonably
well Habited, and not very differing from the
<i>Turks</i> in Dress and Fashion. Those in the Country,
who follow Husbandry, are affirm’d to be a brutish
and nasty People, crusted over with Dirt, and stinking
of Smoak and their abominable Fuel; for they burn
their own Dung, and that of Cattle, instead of Wood,
which is here so scarce it is sold by weight, and
us’d only by Foreigners and the richer sort. Nothing
now remains among them of the laudable Arts of
their Ancestors, but a ridiculous affectation of Divination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and Fortune-telling, in which, and some other
cheating Tricks, they are very well vers’d, great numbers
of them wandring from Place to Place, to get their
Livelihoods that way. This occasions Vagabonds and
Straglers of other Nations, who pretend to the same
false Arts to assume their Names. The whole Body
of the present Inhabitants is an hotchpotch or medly
of many foreign Nations, such as <i>Moors</i>, <i>Arabians</i>,
<i>Turks</i>, <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Jews</i>, <i>Franks</i>, &amp;c. the natural <i>Egyptians</i>
making the least part of the number.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Make</i>, <i>Complexion</i> and <i>Temper</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now as concerning the Make, Complexion, Temper
and Constitution of the <i>Egyptians</i> in general, that
varies according to the different Quality or Employ
of the Person or Sex. Those that dwell in <i>Cairo</i> and
other Cities are gross, corpulent and sanguine, whereas
the wandring <i>Arabians</i> and Husbandmen are meagre
and slender, very active and nimble, yet withal
hairy, sweaty, and almost scorcht and burnt up with
the Sun. The People in general are of a mean Stature,
tawny Complexion, and spare Bodies, and this
is remarkable of them, that tho’ their Country be in
the same Climate with <i>Barbary</i>, yet are they not black,
but tawny or olive-colour’d. The Women are of the
same Complexion with the Men, yet well shap’d and
featur’d, did not they too much affect a seeming Corpulency,
which if they cannot get in Flesh they will
be sure to have in Cloaths.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their <i>Women</i> fruitful in <i>Children</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They Marry at Ten, or
at farthest at Twelve Years of Age, being very fruitful,
some bearing Three or Four Children at a Birth; and
those that are born in the Eighth Month live to a
good Age, and are not in such danger of Death, as
in other Countries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their <i>Constitutions</i> and <i>Habits</i> of <i>Body</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>As to the Constitutions of the <i>Egyptians</i>, they are
hot and dry, being by nature very wakeful and little
inclin’d to sleep. They are of a chearful Temper,
yet delight much in an idle and lazy kind of Life,
being immoderate Votaries to <i>Venus</i>. Their continual
Bathing, drinking the Waters of <i>Nile</i>, and using
cold Food, mightily lessen and alter their heat and
drought; but then this inconveniency ensues, that
they have cold and raw Stomachs full of Phlegm,
which not only proceeds from such cold Dyet, but
also from the extraordinary heat of the Air, whereby
the natural heat is overcome.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Are very long <i>liv’d</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>They are nevertheless said to be longer liv’d than
those of other Countries, it being common to find
among them People of above a Hundred Years of
Age. The reason of this longœvity Phisicians differ
greatly about, yet assign, as the chiefest Cause of it,
next to the Air, the spare way of living of that People,
they eating little Flesh, but store of Roots, Fruits and
Herbs, nor often drinking any Wine, but commonly
Water, and sometimes Beer, which <cite>Herodotus</cite> Lib. 1.
Sect. 77. assures us the antient <i>Egyptians</i> made. On the
contrary, all <i>Europeans</i>, who drink abundance of Wine,
and eat much Flesh, are for the most part short liv’d.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A <i>Problem</i>
concerning
<i>Diet</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Therefore whether it were not better for us to conform to
the simple Diet of our Forefathers? Whether pure and
simple Waters be not more healthful than fermented Liquors?
Whether there be not an ample sufficiency in the
Food of Honey, Oil, and several parts of Milk; in the
great variety of Grains, Pulses and all sorts of Fruits,
since either Bread or Beverage may be made almost of all
of them? Whether Nations have rightly confin’d themselves
to peculiar Meats? Whether the common Food of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>one Country be not more agreeable to another? How
indistinctly all Tempers apply to the same, and how the
Diet of Youth and old Age is confounded, are Considerations
worth our notice</i>, says Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i> in his <cite>Vulgar
Errors</cite>, p. 138. <i>and might not a little prolong our
Days</i>; yet must not this Discourse, therefore I will
proceed to speak of some Diseases the <i>Egyptians</i> have
been always liable to.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their <i>Diseases</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
These are occasion’d either by
the intemperate Air, the Summers here being exceeding
hot and sultry, or else by reason the Poor, who
are very numerous, are necessitated to eat foul and
unwholsome Food, such as the flesh of Camels, of
Crocodiles, (by some worshipp’d and consequently
held Irreligious) rotten salt Fish, and mouldy stinking
Cheese, by them call’d <i>Gibnehalon</i>. They are also accustom’d
to drink muddy and corrupt Waters, whereby
is ingendred much Choler, thick and adust Blood,
gross and crude Humours, which create many Distempers,
the chief of which, and most to our purpose,
are <i>Sore Eyes</i> and <i>Blindness</i>, <i>Scabs</i> and <i>Leprosie</i>,
<i>Dropsie</i>, <i>Frenzie</i>, <i>Malignant Fevers</i>, <i>Poxes</i> of both kinds,
<i>Plague</i> and <i>Pestilence</i>, &amp;c. which tho’ other Nations
are likewise subject to, yet it being not so constantly
or grieviously, these may properly enough be nam’d,
<i>The Plagues of</i> Egypt; wherefore I shall a little expatiate
upon them, with a suitable Application to our Subject
of <i>Embalming</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sore Eyes</i> and <i>Blindness</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>First</i>, I shall take notice of the incredible number
of blind People in <i>Egypt</i>, but more-especially in <i>Cairo</i>,
where sore Eyes or <i>Opthalmia</i> are so common, scarce
half the Inhabitants escape them. Nay, new-born infants
are so troubl’d with this Distemper, that it is
sometimes hardly to be cur’d, for it seems a Disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>lodg’d in the Blood, of which the Natives give this
Reason, <i>viz.</i> That the subtile Particles of the Lime,
wherewith their Houses are built, being carry’d about
by the Wind, stick so close to the Eyes, that they not
only cause Inflammations, but likewise insensibly mixing
with the Blood, occasion this Distemper to be Hereditary;
to which <i>Sandys</i> adds, as other Causes of this
Disease, the reflecting heat of the Sun, the salt Dust of
the Soil, and the Inhabitants excessive Venery; wherefore
did they not use frequent Bathings in this Country,
the stinking Sweat of their Bodies, mix’d with this
Dust, which so continually rises and adheres to them,
wou’d, by stopping their Pores, not only render them
nasty and frowzy, but also their Blood becoming Pruriginous,
and exalted by the salt and corrupt Diet,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Scabs</i> and <i>Leprosie</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wou’d, as it often does, produce <i>Mange</i>, <i>Scabs</i> and
<i>Leprosies</i>; so that to keep themselves sweet, clean and
free from these Diseases, they are wont to use constant
Bathings, and refrain from salt Meats, which are very
unwholsome to these <i>Eastern</i> Nations. <cite>Herodotus</cite> assures
us they in his Time abstain’d from Swines Flesh,
as particularly apt to beget <i>Leprosie</i> in hot Countries,
if salted, and if not, or well roasted, infallibly brings
a <i>Diarrhæa</i>, or else turns to some dangerous Fever or
Surfet. <i>Hippocrates</i>, Lib. <cite>Poss.</cite> <i>p.</i> 5. observes, it throws
some People into a <i>Cholera Morbus</i>, that is, It works
vehemently upon them by Choleric Vomits and Stools.
<i>Plutarch</i> likewise remarks, that the very Milk of this
Beast being drank, produces the <i>Scab</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dropsie.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Egyptians</i> also from their too frequent use of
<i>Colocasia</i>, <i>Bammia</i>, <i>Melochia</i>, <i>Beets</i>, and such like Herbs
as occasion thick and tough Flegm, are often troubl’d
with the <i>Dropsie</i>, which swells and puffs up their Legs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>with abundance of hard and gross Humours, like the
Legs of an Elephant, tho’ indeed they feel no pain,
but are only unweildy to walk.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Apoplexy.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>At <i>Cairo</i> rages that most terrible Disease call’d by
the <i>Arabians</i>, <i>Dem el Muia</i>, which in few Hours seizes
the Brain like an Apoplexy, and bereaving it of Sense,
soon dispatches the Patient. Every Year once the
<i>Egyptians</i> are surpriz’d by this Disease, and multitudes
die dayly of it. At the same Time Children are wont
to be greatly afflicted with a malignant kind of <i>Pox</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Small Pox.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
bred out of venemous Damps, arising from the corrupt
Waters of <i>Caleg</i>, a Branch or rather Trench cut
from the <i>Nile</i> to <i>Alexandria</i>. Every Year, when that
River rises 8 or 10 Cubits, it falls into this Trench,
and so runs thro’ the whole City; so that, at the retiring
of the River, this Water, remaining without motion,
stagnates and corrupts: It first becomes green, then
black, and at length sends fourth Pestilential Vapours,
whereby the Air is polluted and this Infection caus’d,
wherefore, some Time before it is expected, all the Children
thereabouts are remov’d to other Places. <i>Sandys</i>
also tells us,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>French Pox.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the <i>French Pox</i> is exceedingly rife among
the <i>Egyptians</i>, which however is not to be wonder’d
at if we consider their hot Constitution, excessive Venery,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Malignant <i>Agues</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>In <i>Alexandria</i> many malignant and mortal <i>Agues</i>
reign about the Time of their Harvest, occasion’d by
drinking the tainted and foul Waters, which the
Townsmen keep from Year to Year in Wells under
their Houses. But the most destructive of all Diseases
to the <i>Egyptians</i> is the <i>Pestilence</i> or <i>Plague</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Plague.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which very
frequently visits them, and is the more prevalent
in that they seek no Remedy for it, as believing none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>can die of it but such as are destin’d by <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>. For
this Reason they never go about to avoid any infected
Person or Place, for that they look upon as Irreligious.
Nay the very Cloaths or Houshold-Goods of such as
die of this Distemper, are instantly sold in the open
Market by Outcry, which none are afraid to buy,
thro’ which mad obstinacy, in this their foolish Opinion,
the Plague has in <i>Cairo</i>, during only the space
of six or seven Months, sometimes swept away above
Five hundred thousand People, as was observ’d in the
Year 1580.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those <i>Plagues</i> which come out of <i>Barbary</i> are the
most pernicious and of longest continuance, of which
kind was the before mention’d; whereas such as come
from <i>Greece</i> or <i>Syria</i> are more mild and of a shorter
duration; for this Disease is seldom or never occasion’d
by Putrifaction of Air in <i>Egypt</i>, unless the <i>Nile</i>,
overflowing the Country too high, leaves its Waters
a long while on the Ground, whereby the whole Land
becoming a corrupt and standing Lake, that by the
Southerly Winds and Summers heat, may be ripen’d
and made fit to send up infectious Steams. That
<i>Plague</i> which begins in the first Months of Summer
is the worst, whereas that which comes later is milder
and ceases sooner. But let the <i>Plague</i> rage never so
fiercely, when the Sun enters <i>Cancer</i>, which is the
Time of <i>Nile</i>’s overflowing, it wholly ceases, insomuch
that not one then dies of it, as has been before shown.
The Reason of this so sudden alteration seems to be the
even and constant Temperature of the Air, thro’ the
blowing of the anniversary <i>North Winds</i>, which then
begin to rise and oppose the moist Nature of the
<i>South Winds</i>, call’d <i>Camsin</i>. Now these cooling, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>well the Air as Mens Bodies, and taking away the
Cause (the infectious Heat) the Effect soon ceases.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus far have I shown how the infection of Air and
Water may occasion many Diseases, which therefore
are carefully to be avoided as pernicious to <i>Embalming</i>:
I shall now only observe, that as the even Temper
and good Humour of Man tends much to his
Health and long Life, so that healthy State and Constitution,
either affords a Natural <i>Embalming</i>, or at
least such Bodies are easiest to be preserv’d. But whether
those Bodies that dy’d of the Plague, or other
malignant Distempers, could with any Art be preserv’d,
is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quære</span></i> of no small concern in this our <i>Natural
History</i>, and must needs to the <i>Egyptians</i> bring a great
scruple of Conscience, who believ’d the <i>Metempsychosis</i>
or Transmigration of Souls, to think what must become
of such Bodies as were not <i>Embalm’d</i>? Since
therefore no History can give us any satisfaction herein,
we are inclinable to believe they could not any
ways be preserv’d, by reason of the immediate tendency
of such tabid Carcasses to Putrifaction, and yet
we know not but the <i>Egyptians</i> might do more in
this case than others could, both thro’ the efficacy
and goodness of their Medicines, and their not being
afraid of the infectious Steams which issue from
such Bodies, during their hot <i>Embalming</i>; which brings
me next to enquire into their Skill in <i>Physic</i>, <i>Anatomy</i>
and <i>Chymistry</i>. In order to this, I shall first begin with
the Rise and Progress of their Physic, according to
the Opinion of the Learned Dr. <i>Grew</i>; and then shew
its Effects, and how it was practis’d, as affirm’d by
<cite>Herodotus</cite>, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, <i>Prosper Alpinus</i>, and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Egyptians</i> first Authors of <i>Medicine</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>‘The <i>Egyptians</i>, says Dr. <i>Grew</i> in his <cite>Cosmologia
Sacra</cite>, p. 265. being from sundry Causes (some of
which we have already discours’d of) the most diseas’d
of all People, were also the first Authors of Medicine.
<i>Mizraim</i> their first King, otherwise call’d <i>Menez</i>, <i>Osiris</i>,
<i>Dionisius</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>, all being Names of the
same Person, together with his Wife <i>Isis</i>, apply’d
himself to furnish his People with wholsome Food.
He with Wine, which he had learn’d to make
of his Grandfather <i>Noah</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Osiris</i> taught them <i>Drink</i> and <i>Food</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and with Water, in
making the best use of the River <i>Nile</i>; and She,
by teaching them, among so many various sorts of
Roots and Fruits,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Isis</i> salubrious <i>Plants</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wherewith <i>Egypt</i> abounds, to
distinguish the <i>Noxious</i>, many of which, as <i>Sulpitius
Severus</i> and <i>P. Alpinus</i> observe, are very sweet
and tempting, from those which are wholsome and
fit to eat; from whence she was call’d <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὑγεία</span> and <i>Salus</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Their next King was <i>Orus</i>, by <cite>Herodotus</cite>, <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i> and <i>Athenagoras</i> in his Apology to the <i>Christians</i>,
said to be <i>Osiris</i>’s Son. This Prince seeing Food already
provided for, bethought himself of some means,
such as they were, for the cure of Diseases. The
first step he took, being affrighted with a <i>Plague</i>,
was to offer Sacrifice to the Celestial Bodies, which
he suppos’d Gods, and the only Arbiters of Life
and Death. Therefore <i>Anebo</i> the <i>Egyptian</i> Priest,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>These <i>Orus</i>, Son of <i>Osiris</i>, apply’d for <i>Physic</i>, by Sacrificing them.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
personated by <i>Jamblichus</i>, in his Book of the <i>Egyptian
Mysteries</i> says, That, even in his Time, they
knew no other way of curing that Disease; and
what <i>Isis</i> had found out for Food, he thought best
apply’d to this purpose. So <i>Porphyrius</i> in his Book
of Sacrifices tells us, the most ancient <i>Egyptians</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cœlestibus
litabant</span></i>, with Herbs, Roots and Fruits, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>at first <i>Orus</i> offer’d singly, but afterwards compounded,
supposing them thereby, as is intimated by <i>Proclus</i>,
the more acceptable.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The <i>Plague</i> and other contagious Diseases, being
blown away, as they commonly were and are, by
the <i>North Winds</i>, <i>Orus</i> thought it decent to solemnize
his Sacrifices with Music;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To which he added <i>Music</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and that he had excellent
Skill herein, is witness’d by <i>Diodorus</i>, from
whence also he is taken to be the <i>Egyptian Apollo</i>.
Now finding Music acceptable to the People, he apply’d
that also, with the Sacrifices to which it was annex’d,
towards the cure of Diseases; for which Reason
Music is by <i>Jamblichus</i>, in his Book aforesaid, enobl’d
with the Title of Divine. And it seem’d, for many
Ages after, so necessary to Medicine, as to give occasion
to <i>Thessalus</i>, Head of the Methodic Sect in
the Reign of <i>Nero</i>, to brag, That he could make
Physicians without the help either of Astrology or
Music. Thus all Music consisting in a proportionate
Measure, he saw it requisite the Notes or Tunes,
and Words he us’d with them, should be commensurate
one to the other, and so became the first Poet
or Maker of Verses;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>And <i>Poetry</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which being us’d with Music,
were suppos’d to have the same Divine Virtue, and
came at length to be us’d alone in the cure of Diseases.
And it is by <i>Sanchuniathon</i> affirm’d, that <i>Misora</i>, that
is <i>Misraim</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Thence thought to be the <i>Egyptian Apollo</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was one of those two antient Gods,
whose Sons were the Inventors of Medicinal Charms,
which as it seems were all the means <i>Orus</i>, or the
<i>Egyptian Apollo</i>, invented for the cure of Diseases,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Sacrifices</i>, <i>Music</i> and <i>Charms</i>, upon which three
he began likewise to build the Art of Divination;
and as a branch hereof, his Magical Prognostics in
relation to Diseases.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>’Next to <i>Orus</i> succeeded <i>Athothus</i>; by <i>Sanchuniathon</i>
nam’d, <i>Taautus</i>; by the less antient <i>Egyptians</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Athothus</i> the antient <i>Egyptian Mercury</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Thoyth</i>, and by the <i>Greeks</i> in <i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Thoth</i>. He
was the most antient <i>Egyptian Mercury</i>; said by <i>Manetho</i>
and <i>Eratosthenes</i> to be Son of <i>Menez</i> or <i>Mizraim</i>,
and was therefore younger Brother to <i>Orus</i>,
whom he succeeded by <i>Noah</i>’s Gift, as is witness’d by
<i>Sanchuniathon</i>: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saturnus, in Deum Taautum a Misore
Natum, Egypti Regnum contulit</span></i>. This Man, to add
to what his Predecessor had done,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Inventor of <i>Images</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was the Inventor
of Images, dedicated to the Sun, Moon and
Stars, with their Figures upon them, according to
their position in the Heavens, supposing they would
be more effectually mov’d by the Sacrifices offer’d
to them, if thereby honour’d and represented. And
that none might be without what he thought so necessary
for the Peoples Health, he caus’d the making
not only of Images of Gold and Silver, but certain
Sculptures or Paintings upon Wood or some other
Ground. The Figures or Marks, made upon all
these,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Characters</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
were properly call’d <i>Characters</i>, and were the
original of all those us’d by Magicians in after Times
for the cure of Diseases: Whence it is these <i>Characters</i>,
which were properly made, are said by <i>Jamblichus</i>
to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diis congrui</span></i>, that is, agreeable to the
Celestial Bodies, they were suppos’d to represent; in
which Sense also the Author of the Epistle to the
<i>Hebrews</i>, speaking of the Second Person in the Sacred
Trinity, uses the same word.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The same <i>Athothus</i>, observing how naturally the
Music of the Sacrifices put the Body into many Motions,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and <i>Dancing</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
took thence occasion to reduce the motion of
the Feet, as <i>Apollo</i> had done those of Speech, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>a proportionate Measure, that is, to an artificial
Dance. That he was first Author hereof, is agreed
from his being describ’d with Wings, not only on
his Shoulders, but Heels; and that he had taught
the People to apply it to Religion, is as evident from
the <i>Jews</i>, who had learn’d of the <i>Egyptians</i> to dance
about the Golden Calf. Now, seeing this naturally
conduces towards the cure of some Diseases, ’tis
likely he hereupon invented several sorts of Dances,
not as yet considering their natural but magical Aptitude
to divers kinds of Diseases, supposing certain
Numbers and Measures, might as well as Words,
have a Divine Power. Now that he might make
his Motions with greater ease in so hot a Country,
’tis probable he danc’d half naked, as <i>David</i> did before
the Ark, disdaining the Author of this Ceremony
should shew more Zeal before an Idol, than he
did before the true <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>. Therefore as the word
<i>Gymnasium</i> does properly signifie the Place where
People exercise themselves when stripp’d; so upon this
Foundation, which <i>Athothus</i> or the first <i>Egyptian
Mercury</i> laid, was afterwards rais’d the <i>Gymnastic Art</i>.
For this Cause also <i>Jamblichus</i>, speaking of the Powers
which flow from the Gods, among those which
co-operate with Nature, mentions only the <i>Medicinal</i>
and <i>Gymnastic</i> as the two principal, and of kin
to each other; nor is there ground to imagine, that
in Medicine, <i>Athothus</i> or the first <i>Mercury</i>, understood
any Thing more. So that all the means the <i>Egyptians</i>
made use of hitherto in the cure of Diseases,
<i>viz.</i> ’till about the 350th Year after the Flood, were
to be referr’d intirely to their practical <i>Theology</i>, stil’d
by <i>Jamblichus</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεουργική<a id='t171'></a> τέχνη</span>, of which their magical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Medicine was a principal part.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sacrific’d <i>Animals</i>, and learn’d <i>Embalming</i> and <i>Anatomy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
After him they began
to Sacrifice Animals as well as Plants, and
learn’d the <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i>. The Priests had hereby
an opportunity of observing the structure of the inward
Parts; and so of making many, both Anatomic
and Pathologic Remarks. In doing this it appears
by what <i>Pliny</i> says, <i>Lib.</i> 19. 5. <i>That Kings themselves
did often assist</i>. Also frequently perceiving
the inefficacy of their <i>Magic</i>, they began likewise
to enquire into the Physical power of Herbs, and other
Remedies proper for the cure of Diseases, and
the Cures suppos’d to be made, whether by natural
or magical Arts, were preserv’d by some sort of Memoirs
made of them by the Priests,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Serapis</i> or <i>Apis</i> the <i>Egyptian Æsculapius</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wherein a more
especial care was taken by <i>Serapis</i> or <i>Apis</i> one of the
Chief, and the <i>Egyptian Æsculapius</i>. Upon these accounts,
the Priests, as they were the Doctors in Philosophy,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Priests</i> the proper <i>Physicians</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so were they the only Physicians, properly
so call’d, by whom Directions were given to <i>Surgeons</i>,
<i>Embalmers</i>, and all other Operators appertaining
to Medicine. They were also of that honourable
Degree, as <i>Gyraldus</i> reports from <i>Plato</i>,
that out of them the Kings were often chosen. For
altho’ the Servants of <i>Joseph</i>, who <i>Embalm’d</i> his Father,
were term’d Physicians, yet are we to understand
those Men, who were directed by the Priests, the true
Physicians, to be only Operators in curing the Infirm
or <i>Embalming</i> the Dead. Wherefore the <i>Septuagint</i>,
who knew the Law in this Case, do not say,
the Command was given <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοῖς Ἰατροῖς</span> but <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοῖς ἐνταφιασταῖς</span><a id='t172'></a>,
a sort of Men to whom the Care of Funerals was
committed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>‘The next and greatest Improver and Patron of the
<i>Egyptian</i> Medicine,

says <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, and others after him, from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμηνεύω</span>, by reason he interpreted the <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
and Sacred <i>Language</i>: But this tho’ he did, yet the
derivation of his Name from thence is a fiction;
for according to the <i>Greek</i> manner of deriving a
Noun from a Verb, he should not have been call’d
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμῆς</span> but <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμηνεὺς</span>; and therefore on the contrary, as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑλληνίος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλληνίζω</span> and other like Words, are all deriv’d
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἕλλην</span> the Son of <i>Deucalion</i>, who first planted
<i>Greece</i>; so <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμηνεύς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμηνεύω</span>, and other Words of the
same nature are all deriv’d from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμῆς</span><a id='t173'></a>; for the Original
whereof, we are not to look into <i>Greece</i> but <i>Egypt</i>,
where we find <i>Armais</i>, one of their Kings, and somewhat
junior to <i>Moses</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Suppos’d to be <i>Armais</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as <i>Hermes</i> is also said to be.
The radical Letters in both are also the same.
This <i>Armais</i> was also call’d <i>Amersis</i> or <i>Mersurius</i>, and
so by mistake <i>Mercurius</i>; the <i>Coptic</i> Letter <i>Sima</i> being
written like the <i>Roman</i> C, and also <i>Trismegistus</i>,
or thrice very great, answerable to a like <i>Egyptian</i>
Name, now lost, given him,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A great <i>Philosopher</i>, <i>Priest</i> and <i>King</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

<div class='sidenote'>The second <i>Mercury</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>‘This second <i>Mercury</i>, having before him a considerable
stock of Observations provided by the Priests,
and several others of his own, compos’d all, as <i>Jamblichus</i>
from <i>Sulencus</i> and <i>Manetho</i> reports, into many
thousands of Volumes, that is, of so many Leaves
roul’d up of Books, afterwards made of these Volumes.
<i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, <i>Strom.</i> 6. says, <i>There
were Forty two which were useful</i>; six of them appertaining
to Medicine, <i>viz.</i> of <i>Anatomy</i>, <i>Diseases</i>, <i>Surgery</i>,
<i>Pharmacy</i>, particular Medicines for the <i>Eyes</i>, infected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>with many Diseases in <i>Egypt</i>, and lastly for
<i>Women</i>; which Books became, as may be gather’d
from <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, as it were the Statute-Law in
<i>Egypt</i>, for the practice in Physic in after Times.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The great establisher of <i>Magic</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Yet
in all these Books, it is certain, with the physical Account
of Things, there was a mixture of <i>Magic</i>; the
Author of them being the great Establisher of this Art.
Now if some Chronologers are not mistaken when
they say <i>Armais</i> was the King who was drown’d in
the <i>Red-Sea</i>, then this same <i>Armais</i>, that is, <i>Hermes
Trismegistus</i> must be the very Man, who by his Magicians
contended with <i>Moses</i>; and was therefore
rais’d up, the more remarkably to confound them
at his fall. It is manifest the Books now and antiently
extant, under this <i>Hermes</i>’s Name, are all of this
Nature; which tho’ not written by him, but by certain
of the later <i>Egyptian</i> Priests, are believ’d by <i>Jamblichus</i>,
<i>Porphirius</i> and others, faithfully to represent
his Sense. Therefore <i>Celsus</i>, also quoted by <i>Origen</i>
against him, <i>Lib.</i> 8. tells us, as a piece of <i>Egyptian
Philosophy</i>, in his Time current, That the Body of
Man was divided into Thirty six Parts; each of
which was possess’d with a <i>God</i> or <i>Dæmon</i>, which being
call’d upon by the <i>Magi</i>, cur’d the Diseases of the
parts they possess’d. And as they appropriated several
unto one Man, so, says <cite>Herodotus</cite>, did they to every
Beast one; to all, says <i>Justin</i>, but the <i>Hog</i>. And by
the Author of the Book entitul’d, <i>Trismegisti Asclepias</i>,
the same in effect is said of Plants and Stones,
<i>viz.</i> That there was <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ<a id='t174'></a> Θεῖον</span>, something of Divinity
in them all; nor was the magical Ceremony laid
aside in <i>Galen</i>’s Time, as appears by what he reports
of one <i>Pamphilus</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui ad Præstigiaturas Ægyptias versus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>fuit, junctis Incantationibus quas obmurmurat, cum
Herbas colligunt</span></i>. Also the Author of the Book, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De

of the <i>Egyptian</i> Priests, has this passage, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Laudamus

<div class='sidenote'><i>Magical Medicine</i> spread over most <i>Countries</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>‘Nor did magical Medicine keep within <i>Egypt</i> only,
but was thence spread abroad into most other
Countries, partly as they fell under the Government
of some of their conquering Kings, and partly as
<i>Egypt</i> was the great Academy, to which the Philosophers
of other Nations made their resort, and
whence Physicians were often call’d unto Foreign
Princes, who, with their physical, carry’d abroad
their magical Skill. The younger <i>Apollo</i> was Author
of <i>Divination</i> in <i>Greece</i>, as the elder was in
<i>Egypt</i>. Also in <i>Epidaurus</i>, <i>Cous</i> and other Places,
his Temple was always full of sick People; as was
likewise that of <i>Æsculapius</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Medicines</i>, why call’d <i>Pharmaca</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>‘Medicines were term’d <i>Pharmaca</i>, which antiently
signify’d Poysons, because it was believ’d, unless they
were magically us’d, they would do more hurt than
good; therefore <i>Jarchas</i>, in his Life of <i>Apollonius</i>,
tells us also, They who were esteem’d Sons of <i>Æsculapius</i>
had made but small proficiency in the Art of
Medicine, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nisi Æsculapius, juxta Patris sui Vaticinia,

Oriental Nations without their <i>Teraphim</i>, a sort of
constellated Images, by them so call’d, and us’d, among
other purposes, in the cure of Diseases; from
whence <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεραπεύω</span>, signifies both to worship and heal.
<i>Eusebius</i> also in his <cite>Prol. ad</cite> Lib. 4. <cite>Præp. Evang.</cite> reduces

puta, <i>ab studio Sapientiæ separavit</i></span>: that is, from
<i>magical Theology</i>, the reputed Wisdom of those
Times.’</p>

<p class='c009'>That this was the antient state of Medicine in <i>Egypt</i>,
and all over the World, is farther apparent from the
<i>Hebrews</i>, being peremptorily requir’d to expel from
among them, all such as practis’d the same, <cite>Deut.</cite> 18.
10, 11. Those who Sacrifice their Children, as the
<i>Phænicians</i> did for a Remedy against the Plague, as
also Diviners, Observers of Times, Enchanters, Witches,
Charmers, Consulters of Familiar Spirits, Wizards and
Necromancers; so many kinds of Magicians, who
among other Things, undertook the Cure and Prognostics
of Diseases, so many several ways, particularly
the Charmer, <i>v.</i> 11. term’d by the <i>Septuagint</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαρμακὸς ἐπαείδων ἐπαοιδήν</span><a id='t176'></a> one that us’d Medicines and
Charms together:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Magic</i> us’d in <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus was <i>Magic</i> so generally mix’d
by the <i>Egyptians</i> with their <i>Physic</i>, that the very Dead
that were <i>Embalm’d</i> were not free from it. This appears
from the various Ornaments of their <i>Mummies</i>,
being adorn’d with painted Characters and Hieroglyphics,
and defended by several little Idols or Averruncal
Gods. Some of these were plac’d within the Bodies,
as suppos’d, perhaps to preserve them from Corruption;
and others were sow’d to their out-sides,
plac’d upon their Tombs, or in their Burial-Vaults, there
to guard them from external Injuries, and by the
various Shapes they represented, to deter Men from
violating them; but of these we shall speak more particularly
in another place.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Yet however Superstitious and Idolatrous the antient
<i>Egyptians</i> were in Magical Physic, they were soon
convinc’d of the inefficacy of such Practices, therefore
study’d other Methods and Physical Remedies, which
might prove more prevalent; and altho’ they did not
immediately leave off the former, yet was it to the
latter only their admirable success in Physic was owing.
In like manner are we to believe the preservation
of dead Bodies was not effected by those Charms
or Idols, found about them, but purely perform’d by
an extraordinary Skill in <i>Medicine</i> and <i>Anatomy</i>, and
particularly in that exquisite <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i>. In
this, that they might be the better instructed, and more
thoroughly knowing, they took such infallible Methods,
as none could hardly be ignorant of that part
they were to perform; for they had these several Persons
belonging to and employ’d in <i>Embalming</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Persons</i> how qualify’d for <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
each
performing a distinct and separate Office, <i>viz.</i> a <i>Designer</i>
or <i>Painter</i>, a <i>Dissector</i> or <i>Anatomist</i>, a <i>Pollinctor</i> or
<i>Apothecary</i>, an <i>Embalmer</i> or <i>Surgeon</i>, and a <i>Physician</i>
or <i>Priest</i>, which last was a great <i>Philosopher</i>, and taught
and instructed the others in these Ceremonies, as we
shall shew in its proper Place.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this means, not only the Art of <i>Embalming</i>, but
likewise every branch of Physic, flourish’d and came
to the greatest perfection, whereas, in our Age, every
Art grows the more imperfect as it incroaches on another,
and the civil Wars now a Days between <i>Physicians</i>,
<i>Surgeons</i> and <i>Apothecaries</i> have been the chief occasions
of reducing Physic to so low an ebb; for whilst
these have been fighting for each others Countries,
the Monarchy was usurp’d by <i>Quacks</i> and <i>Undertakers</i>,
who are the only <i>Vultures</i> that attend such Battles, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>order to prey immediately on the vanquish’d Enemy.
Now did every one keep to his own Province, as they
did formerly in <i>Egypt</i>, there would be none of these
Divisions among us, but every Art would flourish and
stand upon its own Basis, and yet, I assure you, it would
be found more difficult to understand, and perform
one Art rightly, than to acquire a superficial Knowledge
of many Things, in other Businesses, which relate
little to the Purpose.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>No <i>Quacks</i> or <i>Undertakers</i> in <i>Egypt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To prevent these, there
were in <i>Egypt</i> no Pretenders to Physic in general, nor
any Artists who medl’d with anothers Province, each
keeping strictly to his own, as <cite>Herodotus</cite> assures us in
his <i>Euterpe</i>, where he tells us, some only profess’d curing
Diseases of the Head, others of the Ears; some
were Oculists, others Tooth-Drawers; some for particular
Diseases in Men, and others for those in Women.
In a word, there were Physicians for every Disease,
but none pretended to more than one. The
same thing was observ’d in other Arts, for better maintaining
of which, a Law was enacted, that if any Person
exercis’d more than one Profession or Trade, he
should incur the most grievous of Punishments; and
King <i>Amasis</i> also made a Law, That such as had no
Profession or Trade at all, or did not yearly make appear,
to the Governors of the Provinces how they
lawfully got their Livelihoods, should be punish’d
with Death. This Law <i>Solon</i> borrow’d of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
and carry’d to <i>Athens</i>, where he had it put in
practice: Is it not therefore a shame for us, who, no
doubt, esteem our selves a much more polite People
than those Heathens were, to suffer a sort of Men
call’d <i>Undertakers</i>, to monopolize the several Trades of
<i>Glovers</i>, <i>Milliners</i>, <i>Drapers</i>, <i>Wax-Chandlers</i>, <i>Coffin-Makers</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span><i>Herald-Painters</i>, <i>Surgeons</i>, <i>Apothecaries</i>, and the
like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Art</i> can never Flourish where they are.</div>

<p class='c009'>Art can never flourish where ’tis assum’d by every ignorant
Pretender, nor be brought to any perfection,
while practis’d by illiterate Persons. We may as well
expect one, that has never seen a Campaign, should
understand Military Discipline; or one that has never
been at Sea, Command and Steer a Ship rightly, as
that an <i>Upholsterer</i>, a <i>Taylor</i>, <i>Joyner</i>, or the like <i>Undertaker</i>,
should be well skill’d in the misterious <i>Art</i> of
<i>Embalming</i>. These are the present Grievances, as well
in Sciences as Trade, and ’till such Time as <i>Quacks</i>
and <i>Undertakers</i>, <i>Hawkers</i>, <i>Pedlers</i> and <i>Interlopers</i>, and
all such Persons, as were not brought up in the Emploiment
they profess, be remov’d; we can think no
otherwise but that <i>Art</i> must sink, Trade be ruin’d,
and every public Office, as well at Court as in the
Country, be ill serv’d: For whence came every Art
and Science, nay all kinds of Learning, to flourish so
mightily in <i>Egypt</i>? And how came it to pass the
<i>Egyptians</i> so much excell’d, and perform’d more wonderful
Works, than all the World beside, but only
by strictly confining every Artist to his particular Emploiment,
and punishing all that any ways interfer’d
with another? But lest we may seem to dwell too
long on this Subject, which we think also more convenient
to be discours’d of in another part of this Book,
we will next proceed to consider, besides their Pharmacy,
the extraordinary Skill of the <i>Egyptians</i> in other
Branches of <i>Physic</i>, such as <i>Anatomy</i>, <i>Chymistry</i>, <i>Surgery</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Egyptians</i> well skill’d in <i>Anatomy</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>That the <i>Egyptians</i> must needs understand the natural
<i>Oeconomy</i> of the Body, appears in that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the first that employ’d their Industry in searching out
the inward Nature of Animals by <i>Anatomy</i>, and first
open’d Human Bodies to discover their respective Diseases.
<i>Olaus Borrichius</i>, <cite>Lib. de Ægypt. Sap.</cite> p. 141.
brings many Arguments to prove their Knowledge in
<i>Anatomy</i>; and among them, this out of <i>Aulus Gellius</i>,
Lib. 10. c. 10. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veteres Græcos, annulum habuisse in Digito
sinistræ Manus, qui minimo est proximus: Romanos
quoque Homines aiunt sic plerumq; Annulis usitatos;
Causam esse hujus rei Appion in Libris Ægyptiacis hanc
dicit; Quod insectis apertisq; Humanis Corporibus, ut mos

Honore decorandum, qui continens &amp; quasi connexus esse
in principatu Cordis videretur</span></i>. <i>That the antient</i> Greeks
<i>wore a Ring on that Finger of the left Hand, which is
next to the little one: And it is likewise said of the</i> Romans,
<i>that they for the most part wore their Rings in the
same manner; of which</i> Appion, <i>in his</i> Egyptian <i>Treatises,
gives this Reason; That the</i> Egyptians <i>in Dissecting,
and opening Human Bodies, which was a Custom among
them, call’d by the</i> Greeks Anatomy, <i>found a certain
slender Nerve, deriv’d from their Finger above-mention’d,
which crept along ’till it inserted it self into the
Heart; wherefore they thought convenient that Finger
should chiefly be adorn’d with such Honour</i>. <i>Macrobius</i>,
as quoted by <i>Polydor Virgil</i>, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Rerum Inventione</span></cite>, p. 140.
affirms likewise, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod ille Digitus annulo ornatur, quia
ab eo Nervus quidam ad Cor pertinet</span></i>. Also in <i>Saturnius</i>,
Lib. 7. c. 13. <i>Disarius</i>, in consulting the <i>Egyptian</i>
Books of <i>Anatomy</i>, says, he found the same. <i>Orus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>adds, that for this Reason the <i>Egyptian</i> Priests anointed
that Finger with sweet Odours; which Doctrine
however, <i>Conringius</i> says, deserves rather to be laugh’d
at than confuted; nevertheless, <i>Borrichius</i> thinks there
may perhaps be a more secret consent between that
Finger and the Heart, than young <i>Anatomists</i> are aware
of, therefore endeavours to prove the same, <i>p.</i> 143.
However, says he, we need not wonder if the <i>Egyptians</i>
were sometimes in the dark, when at this Day the
<i>Anatomy</i> of the <i>Greeks</i> is so empty; and surely ’twas as
easie a matter for the <i>Greeks</i> to have added something
more solid, to the <i>Egyptian Anatomy</i>, as for us Moderns
to have so much improv’d it after them. But
nothing was invented and perfected at the same Time,
therefore we must not imagine the <i>Anatomy</i> of the
<i>Egyptians</i> to have been so compleat as ours is now.
Yet he that shall think the wise <i>Egyptians</i> could be so
absurd as to believe the Heart Annually increas’d the
weight of two Drams, for the space of Fifty Years,
and afterwards gradually decreas’d for Fifty more,
must needs be guilty of too great credulity, since none
can doubt but that Persons of all Ages were open’d by
them, in order to <i>Embalming</i>, and therefore such like
Follies must of necessity have been refuted by ocular
Inspection and Demonstration. That which <i>Conringius</i>
chiefly builds upon, is, that all the <i>Anatomy</i> of the
<i>Egyptians</i> was only instituted for the use of <i>Embalming</i>;
yet, which is likewise confuted by <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 19. c. 5.
where speaking of the <i>Phthiriasis</i>, he says, The Cure
thereof was found out in <i>Egypt</i>, Kings being accustom’d
to Dissect dead Bodies, for that purpose: The
words are plain, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Ægypto Regibus Corpora mortuorum
ad scrutandos Morbos insectantibus</span></i>. This I look upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to be the chief intent of their <i>Anatomy</i>, and not the
use of <i>Embalming</i>, since, if we may believe <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>,
those who were the <i>Dissectors</i> very probably understood
no more than what they were directed to perform
by the <i>Priest</i> and <i>Scribe</i>. The same Author assures
us it was even a very unthankful Office to perform
that; for no sooner had they finish’d their Incision,
but they were forc’d to run away, the By-standers
most commonly flinging Stones at them, as abhorring
to see them exercise such seeming Cruelty on
their Friend or Relation. Yet this does not disprove
their Skill or Practice of <i>Anatomy</i> for other Purposes,
since, besides the foregoing Arguments, we are assur’d
they were well acquainted with <i>Ostiology</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>And <i>Ostiology</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for <i>Galen</i>,
Lib. 1. <cite>De admin. Anatom.</cite> advising as well ocular Inspection
as reading good Authors, says, <i>It is best to be
done at</i> Alexandria, <i>where Physicians, expose to the sight
of their Auditors, the Discipline of the Bones</i>. On the
contrary, tho’ the <i>Egyptian Embalmers</i> did not rightly
understand <i>Anatomy</i>, yet is that <i>Art</i> nevertheless very
requisite to be known, by those who would be thoroughly
acquainted with the more exquisite Methods
of the Moderns; for hereby they may be instructed
how to keep the Muscles, make Skeletons, and prepare
Schemes of the Nerves, Arteries and Veins, as likewise
to preserve the Brain, Lungs, Stomach, Bowels, <i>Uterus</i>,
and other curious Preparations, which serve instead of
Books or Pictures for the Instruction of young Pupils,
and refreshing the Memories of more experienc’d Practicers.
In a word, I may justly say, to <i>Anatomy</i> are
owing those rare Inventions of <i>Steno</i>, <i>Swammerdam</i>,
<i>Ruysh</i>, <i>Blanchard</i>, <i>Bilsius</i> and others, for their new Methods
of <i>Embalming</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Chymistry</i> Invented by <i>Hermes</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>As <i>Chymistry</i> is said to have had its Rise in <i>Egypt</i>, so
is it also generally suppos’d to have been invented by
<i>Hermes</i>. But that this Art was somewhat different
from what we at this Day understand by that Denomination,
appears from the Etymology of the Word,
which the <i>Greeks</i> call, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χημεία, ἡ τοῦ ἀργύρου καὶ χρυσοῦ<a id='t183c'></a> κατασκευή</span>,

Arab</i>, Al,
<i>Alchimy</i>, <i>Chymistry</i>; or, The Art of melting and counterfeiting
Metals. <i>Suidas</i> likewise calls <i>Chymistry</i>, The
preparation or making of <i>Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i>. This was
the true <i>Philosophers Stone</i> which so enrich’d that Kingdom,
and brought all their Arts to a mighty Perfection;
and in quest of which, so many Persons of all
Nations have since fruitlesly consum’d both their Lives
and Fortunes. Whereas, on the contrary, by this
Art the Wealth of the <i>Egyptians</i> was increas’d to that
immense degree, that they study’d means how to expend
what they had heap’d up. On this occasion
<i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 36. c. 12. thus writes: <i>Dicuntur</i>, says he,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter &amp; Pyramides in eadem<a id='t183'></a> Ægypto, Regum Pecuniæ
otiosa<a id='t183b'></a> &amp; stulta Ostentatio</span></i>. But besides their <i>Pyramids</i>,
their <i>Obelisques</i>, <i>Colossus’s</i>, <i>Monuments</i>, <i>Pensile Gardens</i>
and <i>Cities</i>, their <i>Labyrinth</i>, Lake <i>Mœris</i>, and the like
stupendious Works, which cost so many Millions of
Talents, are sufficient Arguments of their Skill in <i>Alchymy</i>,
whence they receiv’d so vast a supply of Riches.
’Tis recorded of <i>Ptolomy Philadelphus</i>, he spent at one
pompous Show at <i>Alexandria</i>, and that even when
<i>Egypt</i> was declining, 2239 Talents, as <i>Athenæus</i> reckons
up, <cite>Deipn.</cite> Lib. 5. c. 8. Not to mention their Statues
and Temples of entire Gold, or the Cedar Ship,
built by <i>Sesostris</i>, which was 280 Cubits in length, the
outside cover’d with Gold, and the inside with Silver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>as <i>Diodorus</i> asserts. We have a sufficient remarkable instance
of their great Riches in the Tomb of <i>Osymanduas</i>,
describ’d by the same Author, about which there
was a Circle of Gold 365 Cubits in compass, and one
Cubit thick, which Circle was afterwards carry’d away
by <i>Cambyses</i>, the <i>Persian</i> Monarch, when he conquer’d
<i>Egypt</i>; besides which, as <i>Marcellinus</i>, Lib. 6. reports,
he took out of <i>Thebes</i> 300 Talens of Gold, and at
least 2300 of Silver. Now, since no Authors mention
any Gold Mines in the Time of <i>Osiris</i> or <i>Hermes</i>,
whence can we imagine they should acquire such exceeding
great Wealth, but from the <i>Chymic Art</i> of
transmuting Metals? Besides the <i>Egyptian</i> Mines, which
perhaps were afterwards discover’d, could yeild but
little Profit, because of the vast Expence and Labour
they must be at in Digging them. What farther seems
to confirm their Knowledge in this misterious <i>Art</i>, is
that, as <i>Suidas</i> reports, the Emperor <i>Dioclesian</i> upon
his taking <i>Alexandria</i>, search’d with the utmost diligence
for all these <i>Chymical</i> Books, written by the Ancients,
and burn’d what he found, both to prevent
the <i>Egyptians</i> growing thereby Rich and Rebelling against
him. It was nevertheless thought, the Art of
making Gold remain’d for some Time, among the
<i>Egyptians</i> of the first Rank, at <i>Colchis</i>, and that by
<i>Jason</i>’s Golden Fleece, was meant a Book of <i>Chymistry</i>
written on Sheep-skin or Vellum, which he fetch’d
from thence. However, at last this <i>Art</i> was lost, and
perhaps for these following Reasons:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How the <i>Egyptians Arts</i> came to be lost.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>First</i>, Because the
<i>Egyptian</i> Priests, who were Masters of all Sciences,
conceal’d their <i>Chymistry</i> as much as might be, lest
others, excited by their Happiness, might envy their
Treasure, and consequently hasten their Ruin. <i>Secondly</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Because these Priests were so obstinate and resolute,
they would rather chuse to suffer the greatest Tortures
than discover their Art. <i>Thirdly</i>, In that their <i>Chymical
Books</i>, &amp;c. being written in secret Characters, and
consequently understood by few, were laid up in Subterranean
Vaults, or private Recesses of their Temples,
for fear of the Incursions of their Enemies, thro’
which means some never came to light. And, <i>Lastly</i>,
by reason of the hostile Invasions of the <i>Persians</i>,
<i>Ethiopians</i>, <i>Romans</i> and others, who ransack’d the Temples
of <i>Memphis</i>, <i>Thebes</i> and <i>Alexandria</i>, where these
<i>secret Arts</i> were kept, burnt that famous Library of
<i>Ptolemy Philadelphus</i>, which contain’d about 700000
Volumes, and destroy’d in like manner the <i>Serapion</i>.
All this consider’d, we need not wonder if this, as
well as their <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i>, be lost. But ’tis farther
to be noted, as their <i>Chymistry</i> was very profitable
to them in making Gold and Silver,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Art</i> of
tinging <i>Glass</i>
and making
Artificial
<i>Stones</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so in teaching
them how to give beautiful Tinctures to Stones and
Glass, as also Enamel, make Pastes, and the like, was
equally curious and delightful. They were wont
to make Drinking-Glasses, call’d <a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a><i>Allassontes</i>, which
would change colour like a Pidgeons Neck; one of
which, as <i>Vopiscus</i> relates, being presented by an <i>Alexandrian</i>
Priest to the Emperor <i>Adrian</i>, was esteem’d by
him as a great Gift and rare Invention. They could
likewise tinge the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lapis Obsidianus</span></i> and <i>Cyanos</i>, with
various beautiful Colours, as <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Lib.</i> 36. <i>c.</i> 26. and
<i>Lib.</i> 37. <i>c.</i> 9. relates. Also <i>Seneca</i> <i>Epist.</i> XC. tells us
<i>Democritus</i>, by being well acquainted with the <i>Egyptians</i>,
discover’d how to soften Ivory, and by boiling a
Stone, learn’d how to convert it into an Emerald; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>those People are said to have made Gems so artificially,
they imitated the natural both in lustre and hardness.
Moreover, <i>Appion Plistonices</i> writes, there was
to be seen in the Labyrinth of <i>Egypt</i> a Colossus of <i>Serapis</i>
9 Cubits high of an entire Emerald, which surely
must have proceeded from a Chymical Operation,
since neither of the <i>Indies</i> have hitherto been able to
produce the like Rarity. By all this ’tis plain the antient
<i>Egyptians</i> knew the more secret and profitable
part of <i>Chymistry</i>, but whether that relating to Physic
was practis’d by them, in the same manner as with us,
is a Matter of some concern in <i>Embalming</i>, but, by
reason of the scarcity of their Monuments or Books,
not so easie to determine. Yet that they were not
wholly ignorant thereof, appears by their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æs ustum</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ærugo</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alumen ustum</span></i>, <i>Diphryges</i>, <i>Misy</i>, <i>Sory</i>, <i>Nitre</i>, <i>Sal
Armoniac</i>, <i>Salts</i> latent in Ashes, <i>Calcinations</i>, and the
like Operations which require the help of Fire;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Art</i> of <i>Distilling</i>, <i>Calcining</i>, &amp;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as also
in that they were acquainted with the <i>Art</i> of <i>Distilling</i>,
whereby Bodies were made Incorporeal, rarify’d
into Fumes, and afterwards kept from evaporating by
help of <i>Alembics</i>, <i>Matrasses</i> and <i>Retorts</i> well luted to
their Heads and Receivers. These Vessels were made
of Glass, and some of them with their Figures have
been describ’d by <i>Zosimus</i>, an antient <i>Chymist</i> of <i>Panopolis</i>,
in his Book <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περὶ ὀργάνων καὶ καμίνων</span><a id='t186'></a>, from whence <i>Olaus
Borrichius</i> had his Plate in his Book <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Hermetis Ægyptiorum
sapientia</span></cite>, p. 156. Now certainly, after all
has been said, no Body will pretend to dispute the use
of <i>Chymical</i> Preparations in <i>Embalming</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Chymical Medicines</i> useful in <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Surgery</i> Invented and Improv’d in <i>Egypt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Surgery</i>, which was another branch of their <i>Physic</i>,
was, as <i>Sanchuniathon</i> asserts, invented by <i>Æsculapius</i>
the <i>Egyptian</i>, first of that Name, Son of <i>Jupiter</i>, and
Brother of <i>Mercury</i>, who reign’d at <i>Memphis</i> according
to the report of <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>. After his
Name several others were so call’d, who, in succeeding
Ages, contriv’d any new Methods of dressing or
binding up Wounds, or added any thing else which
was curious to <i>Surgery</i>. This <i>Art</i> increas’d much in
<i>Egypt</i>, as <cite>Celsus</cite> Lib. 7. <cite>Præf.</cite> witnesses; and <i>Philoxenus</i>,
a very good Author, compos’d many Books
thereof. <i>Egypt</i> also was the chief place famous for
<i>Surgery</i>, insomuch that <i>Cyrus</i> King of the <i>Persians</i>,
when he found no Remedy for a Disease in his Eyes,
among his own <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i>, friendly besought
<i>Amasis</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, that he would send him
an Oculist, whom he accordingly receiv’d with desir’d
Success, as <cite>Herodotus</cite> in his <i>Thalia</i> acquaints us. Likewise
both the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, in case of necessity,
requir’d and receiv’d the like Benefit from the <i>Egyptians</i>;
but that their <i>Surgery</i> was so complete as ours is
now, none will allow, nevertheless, this must be granted,
that they had some Medicaments which we stand
in need of; for <i>Dioscorides</i>, Lib. 5. c. 158. and <i>Pliny</i>,
Lib. 36. c. 7. make mention of the <i>Lapis Memphitis</i>,
which being powder’d and mix’d with Vinegar, they
us’d to anoint any part with which they intended to
Burn or Cut, and it so stupify’d it without any danger,
that the Patient underwent the Operation almost without
any Pain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How useful in <i>Embalming</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span><i>Surgery</i> therefore being of that antiquity, and so
well known by the <i>Egyptians</i>, ’twill be expected I
should apply it to our Subject of <i>Embalming</i>: Wherefore,
as was before mention’d, <i>p.</i> 177. there being several
Persons employ’d to <i>Embalm</i> a Corps, as they
were directed by the <i>Physician</i>, so one of those, to wit
the <i>Embalmer</i>, we take to be properly a <i>Surgeon</i>, inasmuch
as by understanding the nature of Fermentation
and Putrifaction, both of the Juices and Blood, as also
how to cure Mortifications in the Living, he might
thereby be better enabl’d to prevent the like Qualities
in the Dead. This he is likewise more capable of, by
being well acquainted with Galenical and Chymical
Medicines, and Anatomical Preparations and Experiments;
in which Matters, seeing <i>Physicians</i> are generally
most knowing, <i>Santorellus</i> thought it their Property,
and consequently wrote a Book on this Subject,
entitl’d, <i>Post Praxis Medica</i>, which shews what a Physician
has to do after his Patient is dead, <i>viz.</i> To prescribe
proper Remedies for <i>Embalming</i> him, as the
<i>Egyptian Priests</i> or <i>Physicians</i> were wont to direct their
Operators to do. So that ’tis plain, the true Office
of the <i>Physician</i> was to prescribe, the <i>Apothecaries</i> to
compound Medicines, anoint the Body, <i>&amp;c.</i> and the
<i>Surgeons</i> to <i>Embalm</i> and roul it up;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>It teaches the <i>Art</i> of <i>Bandage</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
an <i>Art</i> which scarce
any of our Moderns can equal, and perhaps I may
have been the first that has imitated it, as Mr. <i>Talman</i>,
one of our <i>Masters</i> of <i>Anatomy</i>, can witness I perform’d
on the Body of Sir <i>Robert Jeffrys</i>, whom we
<i>Embalm’d</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A <i>Surgeon</i> the proper <i>Embalmer</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>He therefore whom the <i>Egyptians</i> call’d the <i>Embalmer</i>,
was strictly speaking the <i>Surgeon</i>, for as much
as the <i>curing the Corps</i> was to be perform’d by a manual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Operation, and local application of Medicines,
a Thing which requir’d much care, skill and dexterity,
and which, a Person that is not as well acquainted with
this, as Balsamic Medicines, can never perform as he
ought, or be able to invent any new Method; whereas
<i>Frederic Ruysch</i>, a good <i>Physician</i>, a great <i>Anatomist</i>
and Reader of <i>Surgery</i> at <i>Amsterdam</i>, was well skill’d in
this <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i>, as his several Preparations of the
Veins, Arteries, <i>Uterus</i>, &amp;c. testifie, all which, Doctor
<i>Brown</i>, President of the College of Physicians <i>London</i>,
affirms he saw most accurately done at <i>Ruysch</i>’s House
at <i>Amsterdam</i>, and which he particularly mentions in
his Book of Travels, <i>viz.</i> The Lymphatic Vessels so
preserv’d, that their Valves were very perspicuous,
and the very minute Vessels of an excarn’d Liver clear
and shining. He likewise says, he saw the Muscles of
Children dissected and kept free from Corruption; as
also an entire Body preserv’d, and the Face of one
without the least spot, change of colour, or alteration
of the Lineaments, from what might be expected after
Death, and yet <i>Ruysch</i> had kept them Two Years,
and hop’d so to continue them.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have insisted the longer on <i>Physic</i> and its particular
Branches, such as <i>Anatomy</i>, <i>Chymistry</i>, <i>Surgery</i>, &amp;c.
in as much as they not only teach how to prevent and
cure Diseases, but likewise to <i>Embalm</i> dead Bodies.
Yet seeing the <i>Egyptians</i> were famous in other Arts
and Sciences, such as <i>Painting</i>, <i>Carving</i>, <i>Architecture</i>,
<i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Geometry</i> and the <i>Mathematics</i>, some of which
conduc’d very much to their <i>Embalmings</i>, and others
to the erecting and compleating their <i>Pyramids</i> and
<i>Monuments</i>; it may not be impertinent to enquire into
those Arts, by which <i>Egypt</i> grew into such repute,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>that it was generally esteem’d, in respect to its Magnificence,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Egypt Mistress</i> of the <i>World</i>, and <i>Mother</i> of all <i>Arts</i> and <i>Sciences</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>The Mistress of the World</i>; to its Fertility, <i>The
Magazine or Store-House of the World</i>; and to its Antiquity,
<i>The Origin, or Mother of all Arts and Sciences</i>.
This Digression I hope will be the more pardonable,
in that it will be somewhat diverting to the <i>Lovers</i> of
<i>Art</i>, and also help to give a true Notion of the several
Ceremonies and great Expences us’d about their <i>Embalm’d</i>
Bodies.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Egyptians</i> their <i>Antiquity</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
We will first therefore begin with their
<i>Antiquity</i>, for from thence we may expect the first Progress
or Invention, tho’ perhaps not the Perfection of
<i>Arts</i>; in which point the <i>Egyptians</i> would make us believe,
the first Men were form’d in their Country,
and give so great a number of their Kings, and so
long a duration of their Reigns, as to deduce their
Origin some Thousands of Years before the Creation
of the World; asserting also that they were govern’d
by the Gods about 25000 Years, before their Kingdom
fell into the Hands of Men: But however questionable
this Tradition may be, yet is it not to be doubted
but the <i>Egyptians</i> were of very great <i>Antiquity</i>, and
perhaps the antientest People of the World, from
whom <i>Laws</i>, <i>Arts</i>, <i>Sciences</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i> were first
deriv’d to other Countries.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their <i>Inventions</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now the Inventions commonly
attributed to them are, <i>Geometry</i>, <i>Arithmetic</i>,
<i>Music</i>, <i>Astrology</i>, <i>Physic</i>, <i>Necromancy</i> or <i>Sorcery</i>, <i>Carving</i>,
<i>Painting</i>, <i>Enameling</i>, <i>Fluxing</i> of <i>Metals</i> and <i>Stones</i>,
curious Works in <i>Glass</i>, and making of fine <i>Linnen</i>,
<i>Mathematical Machines</i> and <i>Automata</i>, <i>Pneumatic</i> and
<i>Hydraulic</i> Engines, and various other <i>Mechanical Curiosities</i>;
in a word, all kinds of <i>Learning</i> and <i>Ingenuity</i>,
but more particularly they were the first Inventors
of the <i>Art</i> of <i>Embalming</i>. Some of these we have already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>mention’d, therefore shall only speak of those
not hitherto treated of. <i>First</i> then, The <i>Thebans</i> boast
they were the most antient <i>Philosophers</i> and <i>Astrologers</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Astrology.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as having found out the first Rules for the Improvement
of those <i>Sciences</i>, since they most accurately
observ’d the Courses of the Sun, Moon and Stars,
their Eclipses, Constellations, Risings, Aspects and Influences,
dividing thereby their Years into Months,
and grounding their Divinations on their hidden
Properties; yet did they so manage their Prognostications,
that they could certainly foretel every particular
Event.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mathematics.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>In the <i>Mathematics</i> and <i>Mechanical Powers</i> the <i>Egyptians</i>
were particularly famous, for they had Engines
whereby they could raise their <i>Obelisques</i>, and hoist up
vast Stones to so incredible and prodigious a height
as their <i>Pyramids</i> are. They also devis’d other wonderful
Machines for divers purposes, as some for dreining
Marshes, others for watering Gardens, of which
<i>Diodorus Siculus</i> says, In the pensile Garden of <i>Semiramis</i>
there was an Engine, that, thro’ certain Conduits
or Conveyances from the Platform of the Garden,
drew a great quantity of Water out of the River,
yet no Body was the wiser or knew how it was done.
A third sort of Machines they had for destroying and
confounding their Enemy, with which last they had
once almost reduc’d <i>Julius Cæsar</i> to extream despair,
when he invested <i>Alexandria</i> with his whole Army; for
as <i>Aulus Hirtius</i>, Writer of that War, relates, <i>Ganymedes</i>
with Wheels and other Machines of great force, pump’d
the Water out of the Sea, and threw it from high Places,
with that great force and violence on <i>Cæsar</i>’s Men,
that they thought of raising the Seige. He farther adds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>That by those means he also made all their Water so salt
they could not drink it. But besides these they had a
sort of Water-Works for pleasure, as their <i>Organa
Hydraulica</i> or Water-Organs, and others for measuring
Time, as the <i>Clepsydra</i> or Water-Hour-Glass. They
had likewise other Machines which mov’d with the
Air or Wind, and some <i>Automata</i> that went by invisible
Springs; for, as <i>Cælius Rhodiginus</i> relates, the
<i>Egyptians</i> made some Statues of their Gods both to
walk of themselves, and also to utter certain Words
articulately. As to their Motion, that may be ascrib’d
to some Wheels and Springs within, and their Voice
or Speech, to some Air forc’d up thro’ Pipes plac’d in
their Heads and Mouths. <i>Kircher</i> in <i>Tom.</i> 2. <i>Oed.
Ægyptiac.</i> gives many Examples of <i>Pneumatical</i> Engines,
among the <i>Egyptians</i>, in their Temples. Yet
is there none so remarkable as the Statue of <i>Memnon</i>,
which was made by the <i>Theban</i> Priests with that Art
and Contrivance, that in the Morning, on the rising of
the Sun, and the striking of its Beams upon it, it utter’d
a kind of Music. This was so famous a piece of
Work, that Men travell’d from far to see it. <i>Lucian</i>
the <i>Sophister</i> went to view that Miracle, as he terms
it, and as he tells us in his <i>Philopseudes</i>. The same
did the Emperor <i>Severus</i>, as <i>Spartianus</i> informs us,
and <i>Germanicus</i>, as <i>Tacitus</i>, and <i>Strabo</i>, that judicious
<i>Geographer</i>, went to see it; the like did <i>Apollonius Tyanæus</i>,
as <i>Philostratus</i> writes, which Matter need not
seem fabulous, says <i>Natalis Comes</i>, to any that shall
understand the Power of Art and Human Wit, nor
how expert the <i>Theban</i> Priests were in all <i>Mathematical
Sciences</i>. But I need say no more in particular of
their Art of Building, Carving or Painting,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their wonderful <i>Works</i> in <i>Architecture</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>those will appear much more conspicuous by a Relation
of such stupendious and beautiful Works as were
the City of <i>Thebes</i>, together with its stately Sepulchres,
Obelisks and Temples, all built by them. The Sepulchre
of King <i>Osymandua</i>, the Cities of <i>Memphis</i>, <i>Cairo</i>,
<i>Babylon</i> and <i>Alexandria</i>, the Tower of <i>Pharos</i>, the long
Wall built by <i>Sesostris</i>, the <i>Labyrinth</i>, their <i>Pyramids</i>,
<i>Obelisks</i>, <i>Columns</i>, <i>Colossus’s</i>, <i>Statues</i>, <i>Sphinx’s</i>, <i>Monuments</i>,
<i>Subterranean Vaults</i> and <i>Lamps</i>, and other like
admirable Works, testifie their extraordinary Skill and
Ingenuity in all kinds of Arts to be such, as neither
the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Romans</i>, nor any other Nation were afterwards
capable of. But that you may not, Sir,
be put off with a bare enumeration of them, I will
give such a particular account of them, as will, I
dare say, not only surprise and divert the Reader, but
also lead him into every minute Circumstance of their
<i>Embalming</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Thebes.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>First</i> then of <i>Thebes</i>, a very rich and glorious City,
once the Regal Metropolis of all <i>Egypt</i>, and built by
<i>Busyris</i>, who resided in it. It was call’d by the <i>Egyptians</i>
<i>Heliopolis</i>, or the City of the <i>Sun</i>, and by <i>Strabo</i>,
<i>Diospolis</i>, or <i>Jupiter</i>’s City, by reason he was there
worshipp’d. It was in circuit about 140 Furlongs, or
17 Miles and an half, and was adorn’d with so many
stately Monuments both of Gold, Silver and Ivory,
such multitudes of Colossus’s and Obelisks, cut out
of entire Stone, such exceeding splendid Temples, Palaces
and Tombs of the old <i>Egyptian Pharaohs</i>, and
other such like Ornaments and stupendious Rarities,
that it was not only look’d upon to be the most beautiful
and stately City of <i>Egypt</i>, but of all others in the
World; for it is recorded, that not only King <i>Busyris</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>but all his Successors also from Time to Time beautify’d
and adorn’d it, and ’tis certain it had in it 20000
Chariots of War, and that there were 100 Stables all
along the River, from <i>Memphis</i> to <i>Thebes</i>, towards
<i>Libya</i>, each of which was capable of containing 200
Horses. <i>Pomponius Mela</i> says, <i>Thebes</i> was so exceeding
Populous, it could draw out of every Gate 10000 armed
Men, and that the <i>Greek</i> Word <i>Hecatompolis</i>, which
as some think signifies an hundred Gates, according
to which, <i>Thebes</i> was so call’d by <i>Homer</i>, is not to be
understood literally, but rather to be explain’d to relate
to an hundred Palaces, in which so many Princes
had their Residence. <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 36. c 14. will have
the whole City to have stood upon Arches, so made
on purpose, that the <i>Egyptian</i> Kings might march
their Armies this way and that way under the Houses,
without being discover’d. In this City were also four
Temples, very wonderful for their beauty and largeness,
of which, the most antient was 13 Furlongs, or
above a Mile and half in circuit, and 45 Cubits high,
and had a Wall 24 Foot thick. The Ornaments of this
Temple were suitably magnificent both for Cost and
Workmanship, and the Fabric continu’d ’till <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i>’s Time, but the Silver, Gold, and other Ornaments
of Ivory and precious Stones, were carry’d away
by the <i>Persians</i> at such Time as <i>Cambyses</i> burn’d the
Temples of <i>Egypt</i>. ‘Here, says <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib.
1. cap. 4. were the wonderful Sepulchres of the antient
Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, which for State and Grandeur
far exceeded all that Posterity could attain to even
to this Day. The <i>Egyptian</i> Priests say, That in their
Sacred Records there were register’d 47 of these Sepulchres,
yet which is not only reported by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span><i>Egyptians</i>, but by many of the <i>Grecians</i> likewise,
who travel’d to <i>Thebes</i> in the Time of <i>Ptolemeus
Lagus</i>, and wrote Histories of <i>Egypt</i>. Among these,
one was <i>Hecatæus</i>, who agrees with what <i>Diodorus</i>
relates, <i>viz.</i> That when he was there, which was in
the 180th <i>Olympiad</i>, there remain’d only 17 of these
Sepulchres.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Osymandua</i>’s Tomb.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of the first of these, that of King <i>Osymandua</i>
was 10 Furlongs in compass, and at the entrance,
they say, there was a Portico of vari-colour’d
Marble, 45 Cubits in height and 200 Feet long.
Thence going forward, you came into a four square
Stone-Gallery, every Square being 400 Feet, supported
by Beasts instead of Pillars, each of which
was of an entire Stone, 16 Cubits high, and Carv’d
after the antique manner. The Roof was also entirely
of Stone, each Stone being 8 Cubits broad,
with an azure Sky all bespangl’d with Stars. Passing
out of this, you enter’d another Portico like
the former, but more curiously carv’d, and adorn’d
with greater variety. At the entrance stood 3 Statues,
each of one entire Stone, being the Workmanship
of <i>Memnon</i> of <i>Scienitas</i>. One of these was
sitting, whose Foot measur’d 7 Cubits, and in the
whole magnitude, exceeded all other Statues in <i>Egypt</i>.
The other two were much less, reaching but to the
Knee, the one standing on the right Hand, and the
other on the left, being the Mother and Daughter.
This Piece is not only commendable for its greatness,
but likewise admirable for its Workmanship,
and the excellency of the Stone, that in so great a
Work there was not to be discern’d the least flaw
or blemish. Upon the Tomb there was this Inscription:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>‘<i>I am</i> Osymandua, <i>King of Kings; if any would
know how Great I am, and where I lye, let him excel
me in any of my Works</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘There was likewise at the second Gate another Statue,
of the Mother by her self, of one Stone, 20 Cubits
high; upon her Head were plac’d Three Crowns, to
denote she was both Daughter, Wife and Mother
of a King. Near this Portico, they say, there was
another Gallery, more remarkable than the former,
in which were various Sculptures representing his
Wars with the <i>Bactrians</i>, who had revolted from
him, against whom, ’tis said, he march’d with 400000
Foot and 20000 Horse, which Army he divided into
four Bodies, and appointed his Sons Generals of
the whole.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In the first Wall might be seen the King assaulting
a Bulwark environ’d with the River, and fighting
at the head of his Men, against some that made
up against him, assisted by a Lion in a terrible posture;
which some affirm must be understood to be
a real Lion that the King bred up tame, went along
with him in all his Wars, and by his great strength
ever put the Enemy to flight. Others make this
Construction, that the King being a Prince of extraordinary
Courage and Strength, he was willing to
set forth his own Praises and bravery of Spirit, by
the representation of a Lion. In the second Wall
were carv’d the Captives dragg’d after the King, represented
without Hands and Privy Members, to
signifie that they were effeminate Spirits, and had
no Hands when they came to fight. The third Wall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>represented all sorts of Sculptures and curious Images,
in which were set forth the King’s Sacrificing
of Oxen, and his Triumphs in that War. In the
middle of the <i>Perystilion</i> or Portico, open to the Air
at top, was rear’d an Altar of polish’d Marble, being
of excellent Workmanship, and equally to be admir’d
for its Magnitude. In the last Wall were two
Statues, each of entire Stone, 27 Cubits high, near
which three Passages open’d out of the Portico into
a stately Room, supported by Pillars, like a Theatre
for Music. Every side of the Theatre was 200 Feet
square. Here were many Statues of Wood, representing
Pleaders and Spectators looking upon the
Judges. Those which were carv’d on one of the
Walls were 30 in number, and in the middle sat the
Chief Justice, with the Image of Truth hanging
about his Neck, his Eyes clos’d, and many Books
lying before him. This signify’d that a Judge ought
not to take any Bribes, but only to regard the
Truth and Merits of the Cause. Next adjoyning
was a Gallery full of diverse Apartments, in which
were all sorts of delicate Meats ready serv’d up.
Near this was represented the King himself, curiously
carv’d and painted in glorious Colours, offering
as much Gold and Silver to the Gods as he yearly
receiv’d out of his Mines. The Sum was there inscrib’d
(according to the rate of Silver) to amount
unto 32 Millions of <a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a><i>Mina’s</i>, which is about 100
Millions of Pounds Sterling. Next was the Sacred
Library, on which were inscrib’d these words, <i>The
Cure of the Mind</i>. Adjoyning to this were the Images
of all the Gods in <i>Egypt</i>, to every one of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the King was making Offerings, peculiarly belonging
to each of them, that <i>Osiris</i> and all his Associates,
who were plac’d at his Feet, might understand his
Piety towards the Gods, and his Righteousness towards
Men. Next to the Library was a stately
Room, wherein were 20 Beds to set upon, richly
adorn’d, in which were the Images of <i>Jupiter</i> and
<i>Juno</i> together with the Kings, and here it’s suppos’d
the King’s Body lay interr’d. Round the Room are
many Apartments, wherein are to be seen all the
Beasts that are accounted Sacred in <i>Egypt</i>, very curiously
painted. Thence you ascend to the top of
the Monument or Sepulchre, which having mounted,
there appears a Border of Gold round the Tomb
of 365 Cubits in compass, and one in thickness;
within the division of every Cubit were the several
Days of the Year ingraven, with the natural Risings and
Settings of the Stars, and their Significations, according
to the Observations of the <i>Egyptian</i> Astrologers.
In this manner they describe the Sepulchre of King
<i>Osymandua</i>, which seems far to exceed all others both
for Magnificence and curiosity of Workmanship.’
Now he who shall seriously consider this, as also several
other Passages in <cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> of
the stupendious Works of the <i>Egyptians</i>, says <i>Greaves</i>
in his <cite>Pyramidographia</cite>, p. 9. must needs acknowledge,
that for Magnificence, if not for Art, they far exceeded
the <i>Grecians</i> and <i>Romans</i>, even when their Empires
were at the highest pitch and most flourishing: Wherefore
those <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Admiranda Romæ</span></i>, collected by <i>Justus Lipsius</i>,
are hardly admirable, if compar’d with some of
these. At this Day there is scarce any great Column
or Obelisk remaining in <i>Rome</i> worthy of Note, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>has not antiently been brought hither out of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

a great and eminent City, built
by <i>Uchoreus</i>, as <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib. 1. relates, but
<i>Sandys</i> says ’twas built by <i>Ogdoo</i>, and call’d <i>Memphis</i>
after the Name of his Daughter, compress’d, as they
feign, by <i>Nilus</i> in the likeness of a Bull. Hereupon
this became the Regal City, and Strength and Glory
of all <i>Egypt</i>, being exceeding Populous, and adorn’d
with a world of Antiquities. It was particularly famous
for the Temple of <i>Apis</i>, the Subterranean Vaults
or Burying-Places, and the Pyramids or stately Sepulchres
of the Kings, erected within a few Miles of it.</p>

<img src='images/i_236.jpg' alt='M: Vdr Gucht Sculp: To the Honourable James Saunderson Esqꝫ, who has been pleas’d to encourage this Work, this Plate is humbly dedicated by his most humble Servant Thomas Greenhill.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The God most esteem’d by the <i>Egyptians</i>, and ador’d
at <i>Memphis</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The God <i>Apis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was <i>Apis</i>, a coal-black Ox, with a
white Mark on his Forehead, the figure of an Eagle
on his Back, and having Hair on his Tail of two kinds.
When this God happen’d to die, none valu’d their Hair,
tho’, as <i>Lucian</i> says, they had as good as <i>Nisus</i>, but
shav’d it all off in token of their Grief. Also <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>,
Lib. 1. cap. 6. says, They were then as much concern’d,
as at the Death of their own Children, and
laid out in the Burial of this God, as much, if not
more than all their Goods were worth; for when <i>Apis</i>
thro’ old Age dy’d at <i>Memphis</i>, in the Reign of <i>Ptolomeus
Lagus</i>, his Keeper not only spent all the Provision
he had heap’d up, in burying him, but also borrow’d
of <i>Ptolomy</i> 50 Talents of Silver for the same
purpose. Nay even in our Time, says the same Author,
some of the Keepers of these Sacred Creatures,
have lavish’d away no less than 100 Talents, in maintaining
them whilst alive. After the pompous Funeral
of <i>Apis</i> was over, those Priests that had the charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of the Matter, sought out another Calf, which they substituted
in its stead, with the same Marks as the former;
and this pass’d for a great Miracle among them,
but certainly it was not difficult for evil Spirits, who
might take pleasure in deceiving these People, to represent
to a Cow, when she went to Bull, an Ox with
those Marks, as <i>Jacob</i> made the Goats and Sheep of the
same colours, by placing speckl’d Rods before the
Eyes of the Dams at the Time of their Coition. Thus,
having found an Ox to their Mind, an end was immediately
put to all further Mourning and Lamentation,
and the young God was led by the Priests thro’
the City of <i>Nilopolis</i>, fed 40 Days, and afterwards put
into a Barge, in a golden Cabbin, transported to <i>Memphis</i>,
and plac’d in <i>Vulcan</i>’s Grove. For the Adoration
of this Ox, they give this Reason, <i>viz.</i> That the Soul
of <i>Osiris</i> pass’d into the Ox <i>Apis</i>, and consequently into
all the rest that were successively substituted in his
stead:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sepulchre of <i>Osiris</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But some say, the Members of <i>Osiris</i>, kill’d by
<i>Typhon</i>, were thrown by <i>Isis</i> into an Ox made of Wood,
and cover’d with Ox-Hides (from whence the City of
<i>Busiris</i> took its Name;) and this, as it is reported, she
did, because, as she was in search of her Husband, a
very handsome Bull appear’d to her, which she believ’d
to be him, and whom she afterwards caus’d to be Honour’d
in <i>Egypt</i>, under the Figure of that Animal.
Many other Things are fabulously reported of <i>Apis</i>,
which would be too tedious to relate in particular;
therefore I need only consider whether the Adoration
and Worship of that Creature, came first in use from
being the Sepulchre of <i>Osiris</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of <i>Mycerinus</i>’s Daughter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or from the Account <cite>Herodotus</cite>
in his <i>Euterpe</i> gives of the Daughter of <i>Mycerinus</i>,
bury’d in like manner, which we shall here relate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span><i>viz.</i> That one of the <i>Egyptian</i> Kings, <i>Mycerinus</i>
by Name, seeing himself depriv’d of Heirs by the
Death of his Daughter and only Child, spar’d nothing
whereby he might express how sensibly he was touch’d
with this Loss, and consequently indeavour’d to immortalize
her Memory, by the most superb and sumptuous
Structure he could possibly devise. Instead
therefore of a Monument he order’d a Palace to be
erected for her, with a great Hall in the midst of it,
adorn’d with abundance of Figures and Statues, all
glittering with precious Stones. After this, he caus’d
her Corps to be deposited in a Coffin of incorruptible
Wood, fashion’d after the likeness of an Ox, which
was cover’d all over with Plates of Gold, and had a
purple Mantle cast over it. The Figure of this Ox
was kneeling, having a Sun of Massy Gold between
his Horns, and being enlightn’d by a Lamp hanging
before him, whose Flames were fed with a most odoriferous
Oil. Round about the Hall stood Perfuming-Pans
and Censers, which continually threw up clouds
of sweet Scents and Perfumes. In another Parlour adjoyning
to this, stood about 20 great Images, partly
naked and carv’d in Wood, which as the Priests report
were the Concubines of <i>Mycerinus</i>. But some there
are who speak otherwise of this Ox and those Figures,
<i>viz.</i> That <i>Mycerinus</i> falling in Love with his Daughter
ravish’d her, who thereupon hanging herself for Grief,
her Father bury’d her in this Ox, and the Servants
who betray’d the Daughter, and slew the Mother,
were represented by these Images, as having been accessary
to such Wickedness. This Sepulchral Story,
<i>Porus</i> has very well delineated in <i>Porcachius</i>, after the
manner you’ll find represented in this first Plate. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to return to the City <i>Memphis</i>, said to have been in
circuit about 20 Miles; <i>Greaves</i> tells us, there is not
now so much as the Ruines of any such Place to be
seen, altho’ Monsieur <i>Thevenot</i> affirms, those pretty
near the <i>Mummies</i>, enclining towards the <i>Nile</i>, are
doubtless the Ruines of that City, whose Inhabitants,
even at this Day, in imitation of their Ancestors, bury
their Dead without the Gates, and consequently make
use of the Plain for a Burying-Place. Yet <i>Sandys</i> avers,
’tis not likely they should carry their Dead so far, when
they have as convenient a place belonging to their
City, and this is also agreeable to what some of the
Ancients write, <i>viz.</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Subterranean Caves.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
That on these Subterranean Caves
the City <i>Memphis</i>, and several other Places thereabouts
were built, as on so many Vaults or Arches. Without
doubt they bury’d in both places, tho’ cheifly in
the Plains of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Libya</i>, where, in Caves and
Grots under Ground, are said to be about 40 Sepulchres
of their Kings. In these they were very curious,
sparing no cost, but roofing them over like so many
great Halls, and dividing them into several Apartments,
with Passages out of one into the other, alotting
also to each Family or Person, one suitable to his Quality
and Expense he had been at in making them.
These were like those <i>Hypogea</i> of the <i>Greeks</i>, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cryptæ</span></i>
of the <cite>Romans</cite>, p. 95, 96. and are thus describ’d by
<cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 103. Not far above <i>Memphis</i>, near the
brow of the <i>Libyan</i> Desarts, and straitning of the
Mountains, are the Sepulchres or Graves of the antient
<i>Egyptians</i>, who have been there from the first
inhabiting that Country, and who coveted that place
of Burial, as suppos’d to contain the Body of <i>Osiris</i>.
When discover’d, they are to be seen after this manner:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>By the removal of a certain square Stone (which
is very close fitted, and cover’d over with Sand for
privacy sake) a descent appears like the narrow mouth
of a Well, with holes on each side of the Wall to descend
by, yet which are so troublesome, that many,
says <i>Sandys</i>, who go thither on purpose to see them,
refuse to go down into them. Some of these are near
10 Fathom deep, leading into long Vaults, hewn
out of Rocks, with Pillars of the same, and which
seem to have belong’d to particular Families: Under
every Arch lye the Bodies that have been <i>Embalm’d</i>,
&amp;c. Here also are several Pyramids and Obelisks to
be seen, adorn’d with <i>Hieroglyphical</i> Inscriptions, which
set forth the Riches and Power of those Kings; but
these we shall more particularly treat of in another
place, and therefore here only represent to you the
<i>Ichnography</i> and <i>Schenography</i> of the antient Burial-Places
of the <i>Egyptians</i>, near the <i>Pyramids</i>, out of which the
<i>Mummies</i> are brought, with a Prospect of <i>Memphis</i>,
<i>Babylon</i>, <i>Cairo</i>, &amp;c. The Scituation and Disposition
of these, I presume, will appear very plainly describ’d
in this second Plate, taken out of <i>Johannes Nardius</i>,
at the end of his <i>Lucretius</i>, with the Mistakes amended.</p>

<p class='c009'>From <i>Memphis</i>, the Court of the <i>Egyptian</i> Kings is
said to have remov’d to <i>Alexandria</i>, and afterwards
to <i>Cairo</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Babylon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but in respect that <i>Babylon</i>, now <i>Cairo</i>, lies
opposite to <i>Memphis</i>, as is seen at Letter B, and this second
Plate thereby better describ’d, I will begin with that
first. This, in opposition to the great City of <i>Babylon</i>
in <i>Chaldæa</i>, built by <i>Semiramis</i>, was also for distinction
sake call’d the <i>Egyptian Babylon</i>: It is said to have been
founded by <i>Cambyses</i> the <i>Persian</i> Monarch, the first that
made this Kingdom stoop to the Yoke of a Foreign
Power, and was by him peopled with some <i>Babylonians</i>
or <i>Chaldæans</i> transplanted thither. It stood at
some distance towards the <i>South</i> of <i>Cairo</i>, where now
appear nothing hardly but great Mountains of Ruines,
among which many of the Christian Temples and
Monasteries lye in rubbish. The Castle hereof serv’d
long after for a Garrison of three Legions, appointed
to defend this Country in the Time of the <i>Romans</i>. Adjoyning
to this Castle are Store-Houses,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Granaries</i> of <i>Joseph</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
suppos’d to be
of the Granaries of <i>Joseph</i>, which, as they say, he built,
and therein laid up Corn against the ensuing Famine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>In all they were seven, but now three only are standing,
which are also employ’d to the same use: From
hence, for the space of 20 Miles up the River, there
are nothing but Ruines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Old <i>Cairo</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>From the Ruines of this City, <i>Babylon</i>, Old <i>Cairo</i>
was rais’d, being heretofore a most stately City, but
now in a manner desolate, having been alter’d several
Times, as the Conquerors or Lords of the Country
thought fit. At length a more convenient and pleasant
place of Abode was pitch’d upon, when about half a
League off the Old,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>New <i>Cairo</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they built New <i>Cairo</i>, which for
a long Time has been, and at present is, the chief City
or <i>Metropolis</i> of all <i>Egypt</i>. The <i>Italians</i> call it <i>Alcairo</i>,
and others, by way of Excellency, <i>Grand Cairo</i>. It is
scituate on the <i>East</i> side of <i>Nile</i>, in a very pleasant
Plain, at the foot of the rocky Mountain <i>Muccat</i>,
winding therewith, and representing the form of a
Crescent. It stretches, says <cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 92. <i>South</i> and
<i>North</i>, with the adjoyning Suburbs, five <i>Italian</i> Miles,
and is in breadth scarce one and a half where it is
broadest; but as to the bigness or circumference of
this City, Authors differ very much, because some
will have it consist of four Parts, <i>viz.</i> Old <i>Cairo</i>, New
<i>Cairo</i>, <i>Boulac</i> and <i>Charafat</i>, which, if we compare with
<i>London</i>, the City of <i>Westminster</i> and Borough of <i>Southwark</i>,
we shall find it at least three times bigger. For
it is said, the parts of <i>Cairo</i>, together with its Suburbs,
are 10 or 12 Leagues in length, 7 or 8 in breadth,
and 25 or 30 in circuit, and yet is this City so exceeding
Populous, that the People pass to and fro in
throngs, altho’ the Women, according to the Custom
of that Country, seldom or never appear abroad.
Once in seven Years ’tis visited with a terrible Pestilence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>insomuch that 1000 or 1500 have dy’d in a Day,
nevertheless, if not above 300000 die within the Year,
the City is reckon’d to be in good Health, and there
is hardly any miss of the Deceas’d. There are said to
be in it 18000 Streets, 23000 Mosques, and 200000
Houses, besides several Markets, Exchanges, Hospitals,
and other magnificent Structures. Every Street is
known by its Name, and fortify’d with a great Gate
at each end, which at Night, to prevent Tumults and
Uproars, are lock’d up with wooden Locks, and open’d
with a Key of the same; for here all the Locks
and Keys, even of the City Gates themselves, which
are plated with Iron, are made only of Wood. The
number of Men, which every Night guard this City,
is 28000. There is a <i>Canal</i> or <i>Khalis</i>, as they call it,
which runs the whole length of the City, and conveys
thro’ it Water from the <i>Nile</i>. At the <i>South</i> end it is
fortify’d with a stately Castle (the Palace of the <i>Mamaluke
Sultans</i>) scituate on the top of a Mountain,
overlooking the City and a great part of the Country.
It is so large it seems a City of it self, environ’d with
high Walls, divided into Partitions, and enter’d by
Doors of Iron, and has within it spacious Courts,
which in Time past were the places of Exercise. Now
the Ruines of those antient Buildings only show how
sumptuous they have formerly been, for there are
Pillars of solid Marble yet standing, of so immense a
Magnitude, that how they came thither is not the least
to be wonder’d at. ’Tis not therefore without reason
that this City was nam’d <i>Grand Cairo</i>, which is reported
in great measure to be encompass’d with a Wall,
and in which, says <i>Thevenot</i>, there are so many curious
Things to be seen, that a very large Book might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>be fill’d with the relation of them. Among some of
the extraordinary Things to be seen at <i>Cairo</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Hatching</i> of <i>Chickens</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is the
artificial way of Hatching Chickens, upon which the
aforesaid Author well observes, it might be thought
a Fable to relate that Chickens are to be hatch’d without
Hens sitting upon the Eggs, and yet a greater to
say, that Chickens are sold by the Bushel, nevertheless
they are both true. To effect this, they put their
Eggs into Ovens, and heat them with a temperate
warmth, which imitates so well the natural heat, that
Chickens are form’d and hatch’d in them; but for
the particular manner of this, I must refer you to
<i>Thevenot</i> in his Travels, <i>p.</i> 144. where it is to be found
more plainly describ’d. To <i>Cairo</i> are brought, over
Land by the <i>Caravan</i> from <i>Mecca</i>, all sorts of Perfumes,
Aromatics, precious Stones and Gums,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Drugs</i> brought by the <i>Caravan</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
such
as <i>Olibanum</i>, <i>Frankinsence</i>, <i>Mastic</i>, <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Amber</i> and
<i>Opobalsamum</i>, also <i>Indian</i> Stuffs, <i>Indico</i>, and other rich
and valuable Commodities. The <i>Caravan</i> consists of
many Thousands of Pilgrims, that Travel yearly to
<i>Mecca</i>, out of Devotion and for Traffic. That City
is distant from <i>Cairo</i> 40 easie Days Journey, separated
by a Wilderness of Sand, that lies in drifts, and is
often dangerous to the Traveller, when mov’d by
the Wind, thro’ which he is guided in many places
by the Stars only, as Ships are in the Ocean. The whole
<i>Caravan</i> has above 1000 Horses, Mules and Asses, and
500 Camels. These are the Ships of <i>Arabia</i>, and
their Seas are the Desarts. The City of <i>Mecca</i>, Capital
of <i>Arabia Fælix</i>, lying near the <i>Red Sea</i>, is a Place of
great Traffic, not only by reason of the <i>Indian Caravans</i>,
that repair thither yearly with their Commodities,
but also of the Country adjoyning, whose precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Productions have procur’d it the Name of <i>Happy</i>.
From hence they go to <i>Medina Talnabi</i>, or the <i>City</i>
of the <i>Prophet</i>, where in a little Chappel, lighted by
3000 Lamps that burn there perpetually, lye <i>Mahomet</i>,
<i>Omer</i> and <i>Haly</i>, in plain Tombs of the antique Fashion,
cut out like Lozenges. That of <i>Mahomet</i> (not
hanging in the Air as is reported) is cover’d with
green, having on the side a Carbuncle as big as an
Egg, which yields a marvellous Lustre. These meet
again the rest of the <i>Caravan</i> at the place appointed,
as <cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 97. tells us, who gives the foregoing
Account.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Five Miles <i>North-East</i> of the City <i>Cairo</i>, lyes a Village
call’d <i>El Matharia</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Matarea.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
where, in a Garden, is preserv’d
the <i>Balsam Plant</i> as a great Rarity:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Balsam Plant</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some falsly attribute
the natural Production of it to this Country, and
some to other Places, tho’, truly speaking, ’tis brought
from <i>Mecca</i> in <i>Arabia Fælix</i>, beyond the <i>Red Sea</i>, by
the <i>Turkish</i> Pilgrims when they go to visit <i>Mahomet</i>’s
Tomb, and so has been cultivated in several Places,
and renew’d by the same means whenever it dy’d.
Thus the <i>Balsam Plant</i> grew and prosper’d in <i>Judæa</i>,
as is attested by <i>Theophrastus</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Justin</i>, and many
more; nay by <i>Galen</i> also, who purposely travel’d into
<i>Palæstin</i> to see and learn the Virtues of this <i>Balsam</i>
of <i>Syria</i>; likewise from the Story of <i>Cleopatra</i>, who
obtain’d some Plants of <i>Balsam</i> from <i>Herod</i> the Great,
to transplant in <i>Egypt</i>. Yet that this Plant was not in
<i>Judæa</i> before the Time of <i>Solomon</i>, that great Collector
of Vegetable Rarities, appears from the Account
of <i>Josephus</i>, who relates how the Queen of <i>Sheba</i>, a
part of <i>Arabia</i>, brought, among other Presents to
that King, some Plants of the <i>Balsam-Tree</i>, as one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the most valuable Things in her Country; whereby
it appears it was not an original Native Plant of <i>Judæa</i>,
and others affirm also that it had not its natural Growth
there, utterly denying it was peculiar to that Country,
or only to be seen in two Gardens about <i>Jericho</i>.
We are to rely chiefly on the Credit and Authority
of <i>Joannes Veslingius</i> and <i>Prosper Alpinus</i>, who rightly
conclude the natural and original Place of this Plant
to be in <i>Arabia</i>, about <i>Mecca</i> and <i>Medina</i>, where it
still plentifully grows, and Mountains abound therewith.
From hence it has been carefully transported,
by the <i>Basha’s</i> of <i>Grand Cairo</i>, to the Garden of <i>Matarea</i>,
where, when ever it dies, it is renew’d from
those parts of <i>Arabia</i> where it grew, from whence the
<i>Grand Signior</i> yearly receives a Present of <i>Balsam</i> from
the <i>Xeriff</i> of <i>Mecca</i>, still call’d by the <i>Arabians</i> <i>Balessan</i>,
and whence ’tis suppos’d the <i>Greek</i> Apellative <i>Balsam</i>
arose. The Shrub, which produces this Liquor, is
about two Cubits high, with few Leaves, like to those
of Rue, always green, and somewhat inclining to white,
yet which fall not off in Winter. The Wood is gummy,
cleaving to the Fingers, and outwardly of a reddish
colour, with Branches of the same that are long,
streight, slender and odoriferous, with a few Leaves
disorderly plac’d, sometimes three, five or seven together,
after the manner of the Mastic-Tree: It bears a few
small white Flowers, like <i>Acatia</i> or the <i>Egyptian</i> Thorn,
which are of a pleasant scent, but fade in a little
Time. After the Blossoms follow yellow fine scented
Seeds, inclos’d in a reddish black Bladder, very sweet,
and containing a yellowish Liquor like Honey: They are
bitterish and a little tart on the Tongue, and of the same
shape and bigness with the Fruit of the Turpentine-Tree,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in the middle thick, and at the ends pointed. The Juice
call’d <i>Opobalsamum</i>, drops in the Summer-Time from
the slit of the insected Bark, which no sooner comes
into the Air but it turns whitish, afterwards green,
then of a gold colour, and lastly becomes paler.
When ’tis first dropp’d ’tis clear, but instantly turns
thick and cloudy, and when old grows like Turpentine.
’Tis at first of so strong a Smell, that in many
it causes the Head-Ach, and in some a sudden bleeding
at the Nose; but this strong and sharp Savour at
length changes into a pleasant Scent, which in old <i>Balsam</i>
is so weak that you can hardly discover any Smell
at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is another sort of <i>Balsam</i> brought from <i>Cairo</i>,
in Flasks and Leather-Bottles, which is very odoriferous,
yet not the pure Liquor or Gum issuing from
the Bark of the aforesaid Tree, but drawn out of the
Wood and green Branches by boyling. Another sort
is press’d out of the Seeds, and many times sold for
the right, tho’ not so strong scented nor so bitter in
Taste. There is no Medicine more generally us’d by
the <i>Egyptians</i> than the <i>True Balsam</i>, which they esteem
a kind of <i>Panacea</i> for all Diseases, both external and
internal, curing therewith divers sorts of Wounds, as
also the bitings of venomous Creatures. They use it
moreover as a Preservative against the Plague, and to
drive away Agues or Fevers that proceed from Putrifaction.
The Seeds and green Branches, are likewise
us’d against all Distempers that the <i>Balsam</i> it self is:
The same Virtue is ascrib’d to the Wood; but the
<i>Balsam</i>, term’d by the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Opobalsamum</i>, is the
strongest, the Seed or <i>Carpobalsamum</i> more gentle, and
the Wood or <i>Xylobalsamum</i> the weakest of all. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the chief Use of the <i>Balsam</i> for our Purpose, is preserving
the dead Bodies of Kings and Princes; from
which Quality, and on account of its Analogy with <i>Embalming</i>,
the <i>Art</i> it self deriv’d its Name from it, as we
shall show hereafter, when we come to speak of its
<i>Etymology</i>: Its other Virtues, which are very many,
together with a more general Description of it, the
manner of extracting the Liquor, and the true signs
of its Goodness when unsophisticated, I intend to treat
of more fully in my <i>Pharmacopœia</i>, in the Chapter of
<i>Balsams</i>, &amp;c. therefore shall here only insert the Draft
of this Plant, which is very scarce, taken out of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prosper
Alpinus de Plantis Ægyptiacis</span></i>, and represented in
our third Plate.</p>

<p class='c009'>We come next, according to the Method propos’d,
to speak of <i>Alexandria</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Alexandria.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so call’d from <i>Alexander</i> the
<i>Great</i>, who built this City upon a Promontory, thrusting
it self into the Sea, by which on the one side, and
the Lake <i>Mareotis</i> on the other, it is exceeding well
defended. Here <i>Alexander</i> built himself a large and
stately Palace of admirable Workmanship, and all the
succeeding Kings of <i>Egypt</i> so enlarg’d and beautify’d
this City, some with Ports and Arsenals, and others
with magnificent Temples, and such like rich Donations,
that it was then judg’d by many to be second,
if not the first City of the World; being exceeding
Populous, and plentifully provided with all sorts of
Provisions and other Necessaries. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> tells
us, when he was there, he was inform’d by those that
kept the Rolls of the Inhabitants Names, that there were
above 300000 Freemen, and the King receiv’d above
6000 Talents yearly Revenue. This City <i>Alexander</i>
peopl’d with <i>Greeks</i>, immediately upon his Conquest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>of <i>Egypt</i>, and some of his Successors had their Residence
here for 900 Years. This was the <i>Metropolis</i>
of <i>Egypt</i> before <i>Grand Cairo</i> was built; but <i>Alexandria</i>
is now so ruinous, says <i>Thevenot</i>, that many
Strangers ask where it is even when they are in the
middle of it, yet are there such fair remains among
the Ruines, as shew it to have been a wonderful
Place. One of the finest Things, now to be seen there,
are the Walls, which, tho’ ruin’d, are so Magnificent,
one must needs confess they have been matchless.
These Walls are strengthn’d with stately ranks of
Pillars, and have 118 great square Towers, with a
little one betwixt every two, nay, they are so neatly
contriv’d, that there are stately Casemates underneath,
which may serve for Galleries and Walks: In each
Tower there is a large square Hall, the Vault whereof
is supported by great Pillars of <i>Thebaic</i> Stone; there
are a great many Chambers above, and over all a
large Platform, above 20 Paces square. In short, all
these Towers are so many Palaces, able to contain
200 Men each. The Walls are several Foot thick,
and have every-where Port-holes in them, and formerly
encompass’d the antient Town, fortify’d by such
Towers. Next to the Walls, the finest piece of Antiquity
that has withstood the rage of Time, is the
Pillar of <i>Pompey</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pompey</i>’s Pillar.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
scituate about 200 Paces from the
City, upon an Eminence or little Hill, whereby it is
seen at a great distance: This Pillar stands on a square
Pedestal seven or eight Foot high, and each Face about
14 Foot over; the Pedestal is fix’d on a square Base
about half a Foot high and 20 broad, made of several
Stones cemented together. The Body of the Pillar
consists only of one Stone, which some believe to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of <i>Granit</i>; but <i>Thevenot</i> and others affirm, ’tis a sort
of Cement, which, in process of Time, grew into
Stone, or else was cast on the spot, for ’tis aver’d for
truth, the Ancients had the Secret of casting Stones.
But others absolutely deny this Stone was so made,
affirming the antient <i>Egyptians</i> got these Pillars and
Obelisks, that are to be seen at so many places in <i>Italy</i>,
at <i>Saide</i>, where they pretend many have been cut
out and brought by Water down the <i>Nile</i>: If this be
true, what extraordinary Barks or Water Carriages
must they have had, to bring so great a weight, and
in so large a bulk, as was that of this Pillar, nay, what
Engins to raise it on its Pedestal? <i>Thevenot</i> says, No
Artificer could be found that would undertake to remove
it to another place, and that it is 120 Foot high,
but <i>Le Bruyn</i>, who measur’d it, found it to be but 90,
yet as much as six Men could grasp round, which,
according to his Calculation is 38 Feet. On the top
is a fine Chapiter, proportionable to the bigness of the
Pillar, but made of a distinct piece of Stone. ’Tis
said <i>Julius Cæsar</i> erected this Pillar in memory of the
Victory he obtain’d over <i>Pompey</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cæsar</i>’s Palace.</div>

<p class='c009'>At some Paces distant is <i>Cæsar</i>’s Palace, but all ruin’d,
says <i>Thevenot</i>, except some Pillars of <i>Porphiry</i> that are
now entire and standing, yet the Frontispiece is still
pretty sound, being a very lovely piece of Architecture.
About 80 Paces wide of <i>Pompey</i>’s Pillar is a <i>Khalis</i> or
<i>Canal</i> of the <i>Nile</i>, dug by the antient <i>Egyptians</i> to
bring Water to <i>Alexandria</i>, which has no other to
drink. This, when the <i>Nile</i> swells and breaks down
a Bank, fills the Cisterns that are purposely made under
the City, and which are very magnificent and
spacious; for <i>Alexandria</i> is all hollow underneath, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>an entire Cistern, whose Vaults are supported by several
fair Marble-Pillars, and upon these Arches the
Houses are built. Now this Water of the <i>Nile</i>, so
convey’d by the <i>Khalis</i> under the Town, is by Wheels,
with Earthen Pitchers or Buckets, drawn up into the
private Cisterns of each House. There are likewise to
be seen at <i>Alexandria</i> two very stately Obelisks of <i>Theban</i>
Marble, intermix’d or speckl’d with Veins of various
colours: One of these remains entire, but so
sunk into the Earth, that it appears without a Pedestal.
The other is quite bury’d in the Ground, except the
Pedestal only, which is about 10 Foot high; each of
these are of one entire Stone, 100 Foot in height and
eight in breadth, suppos’d to be larger than those at
<i>Rome</i>, and mark’d with such like <i>Hieroglyphical</i> Figures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Palace of <i>Cleopatra</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Near these Pillars or Obelisks are the Ruins of <i>Cleopatra</i>’s
Palace, by whose stately Chambers or Apartments,
in some part remaining entire, it may reasonably
be conjectur’d, it was a very superb and magnificent
Building, as likewise by some remains, still to
be seen on the Sea-side, of a Gallery supported by many
fair Pillars, and running outwards to the Mouth
of the Harbour, so that any one might embark there
from the Palace. <i>Thevenot</i> tells us, in his Travels to
the <cite>Levant</cite>, p. 125. that this City abounds with Marble,
Porphiry and <i>Thebaic Stone</i> or <i>Granit</i>, as also that
among the Ruins, there are several very curious
Stones to be found, such as <i>Agats</i>, <i>Garnets</i>, <i>Emeralds</i>,
&amp;c. like to Medals, some engrav’d with Heads, others
with Idols, and some with Beasts, all being different
from each other, and serving heretofore for <i>Talismen</i>
or <i>Charms</i>. These are so excellently well wrought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>that certainly nothing now-a-days can come up to
them, whereby it appears either their Engravers were
wonderful Artists, or else they had the Art of casting,
or at least of softning Stones; for tho’ some of these
are so small one can hardly finger them, yet are they
nevertheless all engrav’d or otherwise wrought to perfection.</p>

<p class='c009'>This City of <i>Alexandria</i> was likewise very famous
for its Academies or Colleges, endow’d with large Revenues,
and planted with such Persons as were eminent
in Liberal Sciences, who were drawn thither by
Rewards, and cherish’d by Favours, thro’ which means
<i>Alexandria</i> became the <i>Parnassus</i> of the Muses, and the
School of all good Literature. The chiefest and most
memorable Place of all these was the <i>Serapion</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Serapion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or
Temple of the God <i>Serapis</i>, for sumptuous Workmanship
and magnificent Building inferior to none
but the <i>Roman</i> Capitol. It had a curious <i>Portico</i> of a
Mile in length, whereto adjoyn’d a Court of Justice
and a Grove: In this last, the Followers of <i>Aristotle</i>’s
Doctrine had a peculiar School, whereof the <i>Alexandrians</i>,
as <i>Eusebius</i> and <i>Nicephorus</i> write, would needs
impose the Charge on Bishop <i>Anatolius</i>, for his extraordinary
Knowledge in all Arts. St. <i>Mark</i> the Evangelist
was here first Divinity-Professor, whose Successor
erected a School for <i>Theology</i>, wherein, for the advancement
of the Christian Religion, several of the
most learn’d Men were appointed Readers, who scholastically
handled the main and fundamental Points
only: Among these was <i>Pantænus</i>, who read both
Divinity and Philosophy to all such as came to hear
him, which, as it is conceiv’d, gave the first hint to
the instituting of Universities throughout the rest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Christendom, insomuch that, from so small a beginning,
the Schools of <i>Alexandria</i> became so great and
eminent, that <i>Nazianzen</i> gave them the Title of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παντοίας παιδεύσεως ἐργαστήριον</span><a id='t216'></a>, <i>The Shops or Workhouses of
all Learning</i>. Here also St <i>Jerom</i>, St. <i>Basil</i>, St. <i>Gregory</i>
and others were educated, and <i>Philo-Judæus</i> likewise
became eminent, for in this Academy the <i>Jews</i> had a
flourishing and populous Synagogue; but what greatly
encreas’d the glory of this Assembly, was that most
wonderful Library of <i>Ptolemy Philadelphus</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Library of <i>Ptolemy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Son of
<i>Ptolemeus Lagus</i>, the second of that Name of the Line
of the <i>Egyptian</i> Kings, first establish’d by him, and
afterwards augmented and enrich’d by his Successors;
for this King being an exceeding Lover of all Arts and
Sciences, he, with great Labour and much Expence,
made a Collection of all manner of Books, as well in
Divinity as in all Arts, Sciences, History, and the like,
some of which he obtain’d from <i>Greece</i> and other places,
but the <i>Pentateuch</i>, and the rest of the Old Testament,
he procur’d from <i>Judæa</i>. Then wrote this King
to <i>Eleazer</i> the High Priest, to send him six out of every
Tribe to Translate this Book for the common Use.
These <i>Ptolemy</i> receiv’d at <i>Alexandria</i> with exceeding
great civility, and erected several convenient Mansions
for them, wherein every one was by himself to
Translate the Holy Law, which they so perform’d, according
to the Testimonies of <i>Josephus</i>, <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>,
<i>Eusebius</i> <i>Nicephorus</i>, St. <i>Austin</i>, and other
learned Writers, that they not only us’d the same
Sense, but the very same Words also, yet that certainly
not without the special Grace and Assistance of the
Holy Spirit. Now this is the Translation which bears
the Name of <i>Septuagint</i> to this very Day.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Septuagint</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>this King sent to the <i>Chaldeans</i>, <i>Romans</i> and other Nations
for Books, all which he likewise commanded to
be Translated into the <i>Greek</i> Tongue. One <i>Phalerius
Demetrius</i>, a Learned <i>Athenian</i> Exile, was Keeper of
this Library, which amounted, as <i>Agellius</i>, <i>Ammianus
Marcellinus</i> and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> alledge, to 700000
Volumes, and was afterwards from Time to Time
very much augmented by the succeeding Kings, ’till
at length this invaluable Treasure of <i>Manuscripts</i> (for
then the <i>Art</i> of <i>Printing</i> was not so much as thought
of) was burn’d in the Civil Wars between <i>Pompey</i> and
<i>Cæsar</i>, in the 183 <i>Olympiad</i>, after it had continu’d
about 124 Years. This <i>Cæsar</i> ever after accounted
the greatest of his Misfortunes, that he, who was so
great a Lover of Arts and Sciences, should be Cause
of the destruction of so incomparable and unparalel’d
a <i>Library</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Serapion Library</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Another <i>Library</i> was afterwards erected by <i>Cleopatra</i>
in the <i>Serapion</i>, a Building of great Excellency and
wonderful Art: This was greatly adorn’d and enrich’d
by the assistance of <i>Marc Anthony</i>, who acquir’d
the <i>Attalian</i> and <i>Pergamæan</i> Libraries, and which continu’d
during the Time of the Primitive Christianity;
when, in the Days of <i>Theodosius</i> the Great, it was demolish’d,
as a harbour of Infidelity. Among other
remarkable Places in this City of <i>Alexandria</i>, was the
<i>Seraglio</i> call’d <i>Somia</i>, belonging to the Palace, famous
for its being the Burial-Place of the <i>Ptolemys</i>, and of
<i>Alexander</i> the Great,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Alexander</i>’s <i>Sepulchre</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whose Body lay here inclos’d in
a Sepulchre of Gold; but <i>Cybiosactes</i> despoil’d it of that
precious Cover, after which, it was cover’d with Glass,
and so remain’d to the Time of the <i>Saracens</i>, as <cite>Sandys</cite>,
p. 87. informs us. Now since the Burial of <i>Alexander</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the Great was manag’d, in all respects, suitably to his
Grandeur, whereby it not only exceeded all others in
regard of Expence, State and Pomp, but also in point
of curiosity of Workmanship, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib.
18. cap. 3. thought fit to recommend to Posterity
these remarkable and entertaining Matters concerning
it, <i>viz.</i> That to <i>Aridæus</i>, Bastard Son of <i>Philip</i>, and
Brother of <i>Alexander</i>, whom he succeeded, the care
of his Funeral, and preparing a Chariot to convey his
Body to the Temple of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, was commited.
First therefore he provided a Coffin of beaten Gold,
wrought in form and proportion to his Body: This
he fill’d with Aromatic Spices, as well to delight the
Senses, as to preserve the Corps from Putrifaction,
and then fitted it exactly with a Cover of Gold, which
again was over-spread with a purple Pall, embroider’d
with Gold, and near it were plac’d the Arms of the
Deceas’d, thereby to represent the Acts of his Life.
Then were these plac’d in a Chariot under a Triumphal-Arch
of Gold, beset with precious Stones, and
supported by Pillars and Chapiters of Gold also, made
after the <i>Ionic</i> Order. On each side the Arch stood a
Golden Image of <i>Victory</i> bearing a Trophy, and on the
top was a Gold-Fringe of Net-Work, from which
hung Bells so large, that they might be heard at a
great distance. Under this Portico or Arch was plac’d
a four square Throne of Gold, adorn’d with little
Coronets of various beautiful Colours. On every side
of this Arch, from a Net-Work of Gold, a Finger
thick, hung four Tables or Pannels, whereupon were
pourtray’d all sorts of Creatures. In the first Table
was represented <i>Alexander</i> sitting in a Chariot, with
a Royal Scepter in his Hand, his Armour-Bearer before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>him, and his Life-Guards, compleatly arm’d, round
about him. In the second follow’d Elephants, adorn’d
in their proper Habiliments, on which sat <i>Indians</i> before,
and <i>Macedonians</i> behind, arm’d according to the Customs
of their respective Countries. In the third might
be seen Squadrons of Horse drawn up in Battalia; and
in the fourth appear’d a Fleet order’d in a Line of
Battel. At the entrance into this Arch were plac’d
Golden Lions, looking sternly towards those that should
offer to enter. On the out-side of the Arch, and middle
of the Roof, was plac’d on a purple Carpet, a
Crown of Gold, so large, that by the reflection of the
Sun-Beams, it darted such an amazing splendor and
brightness, that at a distance it appear’d like a flash
of Lightning. The whole Work was set upon two
Axel-Trees, the ends of which were likewise of Gold,
representing Lions Heads with Darts in their Mouths.
The whole Machine was mov’d by four Wheels, whose
Spokes and Naves were also over-laid with Gold, and
there were four Poles to draw it by, to each of which
were yok’d 16 of the largest and finest Mules that could
be got, in all 64. Every Mule was adorn’d with a
Crown of Gold, Bells of Gold on either side their Heads,
and rich Collars about their Necks, set off and beautify’d
with precious Stones. After this manner did the
Chariot set forth, the sight of which was more stately
and pompous than can be imagin’d, so that its Fame
brought together Multitudes of Spectators; for the
People out of every City, whither it was coming, met
it, and then ran back again before it, never satisfy’d
with the delight they took in gazing on it; and, suitable
to so stately a Show, attended a vast company of
Workmen and Pioneers to clear the way for its Passage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Thus <i>Aridæus</i> (who spent two Years in Preparations
for it) brought the King’s Body from <i>Babylon</i> to <i>Egypt</i>.
<i>Ptolemy</i>, in Honour to this great King, met the Corps
with his Army as far as <i>Syria</i>, where he receiv’d and
accompany’d it with great Respect and Observance;
for he had resolv’d not to conduct it to the Temple of
<i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, but to keep it in this City which <i>Alexander</i>
had built, being the most famous almost of any
in the World. For this end he built a Temple in Honour
of <i>Alexander</i>, in greatness and stateliness of Structure,
becoming the Glory and Majesty of so great a
King; and in this Repository laid the Body, and honour’d
his Exequies with Sacrifices and magnificent
Shows, agreeable to the State of a Demi-God: Thus
much for the glorious Sepulchre and Burial of the
greatest Monarch perhaps that ever liv’d. Next we
shall take notice of two <i>Physiological</i> Observations on
the Earth and Water of <i>Egypt</i>, made by Father <i>Vansleb</i>
in his Voyage thither, p. 109. 111. where, speaking of
<i>Alexandria</i>, he tells us the Earth thereabouts is full of
<i>Nitre</i>, which is easily prov’d by the following Experiment,
<i>viz.</i> That if you take a piece of Earth and set it
in the hot Sun, it will become white as Snow on that
side that is towards the Sun. Also in the <i>Grand Signior</i>’s
Salt-Pits, that are out of this City, near the <i>Khalis</i>
or Chanel of <i>Cleopatra</i>, he took notice of two things
very remarkable: <i>First</i>, That the Water of <i>Nile</i>, the
sweetest and freshest in the World, makes a Salt, not
only whiter than ordinary, but likewise very excellent.
<i>Secondly</i>, That this Salt has the taste of Violets. The
last thing, but not the least, that I have to say of
<i>Alexandria</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Isle of <i>Pharos</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is concerning the famous Isle of <i>Pharos</i>,
which stands over-against the City, and was formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>a Mile distant from the Land, but joyn’d to the Continent
by <i>Cleopatra</i>, on the following occasion, says
<cite>Heylin</cite>, p. 849. The <i>Rhodians</i>, then Lords of the Sea,
us’d to exact some Tribute or Acknowledgement from
every Island within those Seas, and consequently from
this: Their Embassadors, upon this Occasion, sending
to <i>Cleopatra</i> to demand this Tribute, she deferr’d it
for seven Days, under pretence of celebrating a Solemn
Festival, but in the mean Time, by raising huge
Dams and Banks in the Sea, both with incredible
charge and speed, she united the Island to the Shoar,
which finish’d, she sent away the <i>Rhodians</i> empty-handed,
with this witty Jeer, <i>That they were to take Toll of
the Islands, and not of the Continent</i>. A Work of great
rarity and magnificence this, both for its extent, taking
up the space of seven Furlongs, and thence call’d
<i>Heptastadium</i>, and the incredible speed wherewith it
was finish’d. Upon a Promontory hereof, on a Rock,
environ’d by the Sea, <i>Ptolemy Philadelphus</i> caus’d a
Watch-Tower to be built for the benefit of Sailors,
(the Seas upon that Coast being very unsafe and full
of Flats) to guide them over the Bar of <i>Alexandria</i>.
This <i>Pharos</i> or Watch-Tower was of wonderful height,
ascended by Steps, and having many Lanthorns at the
top, wherein Lights burn’d nightly, as a Direction to
such as sail’d by Sea; yet oftentimes the multitude of
Lights appearing a far off as one, and being mistaken
for a Star, procur’d contrary effects to the promis’d
Safety. This had the repute of the Worlds seventh
Wonder, call’d after the Name of the Island, and is
at this Day a general Name for such Towers as serve
to that purpose. The Materials of it were white
Marble, and the chief Architect <i>Sostratus</i> of <i>Gnidos</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>who grav’d upon it this Inscription: Sostratus <i>of</i> Gnidos,
<i>Son of</i> Dixiphanes, <i>to the Gods Protectors for the safeguard
of Sailors</i>. This Inscription he cover’d over
with Plaister, and inscrib’d thereon the Name and
Title of the King, Founder of this Tower, to the end
that when the King’s Name should be wasted and
wash’d away, his own, which was cut on Marble,
might be celebrated to Eternity.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the South side of the City of <i>Alexandria</i>, near
the Lake <i>Mareotis</i>, wherein the Sepulchres of King
<i>Mœris</i> and his Wife were Pyramidically built, adjoins
the <i>Labyrinth</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Labyrinth</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not much inferior to that Structure, as
will appear from that Description given by <cite>Sandys</cite>, p.
88. where he tells us, ‘That in the midst of this <i>Labyrinth</i>
were 37 Palaces, belonging to the 37 Jurisdictions
of <i>Egypt</i>; to which resorted the several
Presidents to celebrate the Festivals of their Gods
(who had herein their particular Temples, moreover
15 Chapels, containing each a <i>Nemesis</i>) and also to
advise of Matters of Importance relating to the Public
Good. The Passages thereunto were thro’ Caves
of a miraculous length, full of dark and winding
Paths, and Rooms within one another, having many
Doors to confound the Memory and distract the
Intention, and leading into inextricable Error:
Now mounting aloft, and then again re-descending,
not seldom turning about Walls infolded within each
other, in the form of intricate Mazes, not possible
to thred or get out of without a Conductor. The
Building was more under Ground than above, being
all of massy Stone, and laid with that Art, that
neither Cement nor Wood was us’d in any part of
the Fabric. The end at length being attain’d, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>pair of Stairs of 90 Steps, conducted into a stately
<i>Portico</i>, supported by Pillars of <i>Theban</i> Marble, and
this again gave entrance into a spacious Hall, the place
of general Conventions. All this Hall was of polish’d
Marble, and adorn’d with Statues both of Gods and
Men. The Chambers were so dispos’d, that upon
their opening, the Doors gave Reports no less terrible
than Thunder. The first Entrance was of white
Marble within, adorn’d throughout with Marble
Columns, and divers Figures.’ <i>Dedalus</i> is said to
have imitated this, in that <i>Labyrinth</i> he built in <i>Crete</i>,
yet expressing hereof scarce the Hundredth part; for,
as <i>Heylin</i> observes, it fell as short of the Glories of
this, as <i>Minos</i> was inferior to <i>Psammiticus</i> (the Founder)
in Power and Riches. ‘Whoso mounted the
top, should see as it were a large Plan of Stone, and
withal, those 37 Palaces environ’d with solid Pillars,
and Walls consisting of Stone of a mighty size.
At the end of this <i>Labyrinth</i> stood a square Pyramid
of a marvelous breadth and answerable height, being
the Sepulchre of King <i>Ismandes</i> that built it.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>By whom, and to what end built.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But who built this <i>Labyrinth</i>, and to what end, Authors
differ very much, and <i>Pliny</i>, who writes a great
deal of it, gives no certain Reason why it was made.
’Tis said it was first built by King <i>Petesucus</i> or <i>Tithoes</i>,
altho’ <cite>Herodotus</cite> affirms ’twas the Work of all the
Kings, and lastly of <i>Psammiticus</i>. The cause of building
it is as variously reported: <i>Demoteles</i> thinks it to
have been the Palace of <i>Motherudis</i>; <i>Lycias</i>, that it
was the Sepulchre of <i>Mœris</i> (of which Opinion is also
<i>Diodorus</i>) but most believe ’twas built as sacred to the
Sun. <i>Bellonius</i> thinks it to have been a Sepulchre rather
than any thing else, for such like magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Works, as was also the <i>Mausoleum</i>, were commonly
rais’d for that end, and <cite>Herodotus</cite> clearly describes this
wonderful <i>Labyrinth</i> to have been built for a Sepulchre,
telling us, ‘The Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, where they perform’d
their Sacred Rites, resolv’d to leave a common
Monument of themselves, therefore in that
Place, which is a little above the Lake of <i>Mœris</i>, and
near the City of <i>Crocodiles</i>, they built a <i>Labyrinth</i>,
which <cite>Herodotus</cite> himself saw, and which he says was
much bigger than Fame had represented it; for if
any one should reason with himself about the Walls
and nature of this Work, according to the Narration
of the <i>Greeks</i>, he would never conceive the
Labour and Charge of this <i>Labyrinth</i>. The Temple
of <i>Diana</i> at <i>Ephesus</i> is very well worth mentioning,
yet are the <i>Pyramids</i> far greater, the least of which
equals the largest Labour of the <i>Grecians</i>; and tho’
this <i>Labyrinth</i> likewise excels them, yet does the
Lake <i>Mœris</i>, near which it is built, and the Description
of which you have at <i>p.</i> 141. afford much
greater admiration.’ The former of these, <i>viz.</i> the
<i>Labyrinth</i>, is said to have been for the Sepulchre of
those Kings that built it, and for the Sacred Crocodiles;
and the latter to contain the Sepulchres of King
<i>Mœris</i> and his Wife.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Wall built by <i>Sesostris</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Not to describe particularly that prodigious Wall
built by <i>Sesostris</i>, which defended the <i>East</i> side of <i>Egypt</i>,
against the Irruptions of the <i>Syrians</i> and <i>Arabians</i>, being
1500 Furlongs in length, and extending from <i>Pelusium</i>
by the Desart as far as <i>Heliopolis</i>; we come
next to speak of those famous Walls belonging to the
City of <i>Babylon</i> in <i>Chaldea</i>, built by <i>Semiramis</i> the
Wife of <i>Ninus</i>, a Princess, who being naturally of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>high aspiring Spirit, was ambitious of excelling all
others in glorious Actions. So soon therefore as she
had bury’d her Husband <i>Ninus</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ninus</i> his Sepulchre.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
King of <i>Assyria</i>, in
the Royal Palace, and rais’d over him a Mound of
Earth of wonderful bigness, which as <i>Ctesias</i> reports,
standing at some distance from the City that lay in
the Plain, appear’d like a stately Cittadel, being 9 Furlongs
high and 10 broad: She provided her self of
2000000 Artists and Workmen to build this City of
<i>Babylon</i> in one Year,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Babylon</i> in <i>Chaldea</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so ordering it that the River <i>Euphrates</i>
should flow thro’ the midst of it, as <i>Diod. Siculus</i>,
Lib. 2. cap. 1. informs us. She next encompass’d
it with a Wall as many Furlongs in circuit as there are
Days in the Year, <i>viz.</i> 365: This Wall was 300 Foot
high and 75 broad, insomuch that Coaches might
meet and turn upon it; She adorn’d it with 250 Turrets
of suitable proportion: Then she made a Bridge
5 Furlongs in length, over the narrowest part of the
River, and Floor’d it with great Joists and Planks of Cedar,
Cypress and Palm-Tree, 30 Foot long: At each
end of this Bridge, just on the Brink of the River, she
built a Palace, whence she might have a Prospect of
the whole City: Then in a low Ground she sunk a four
square Pond, every Square being 300 Furlongs and
the depth of the whole 35 Foot, lining it with Bricks,
cemented together with a sort of <i>Bitumen</i> of a very
glutinous Nature like <i>Asphalt</i>, which work’d out of the
Earth so plentifully thereabouts, that it not only supply’d
the People with Fuel, but serv’d them also instead
of Mortar for their Buildings, and with which both
the Palaces and Walls of this City were cemented.
Afterwards, by turning the River aside, she made a
Passage in the nature of a Vault from one Palace to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>another, and then let the Water again into its former
Channel, which immediately overflow’d the whole
Work, by which means she could go under the River
when she had not a mind to pass over it. She likewise
made two brazen Gates, one at each end of this Vault,
as also Banqueting-Houses of Brass, into which passages
were open’d by certain Engins. Here might be
seen brazen Statues of <i>Ninus</i>, <i>Semiramis</i> and all the great
Officers, as likewise Armies drawn up in <i>Battalia</i>.
These Palaces were moreover surrounded with Walls,
30 Furlongs in circuit, with Turrets on them 140
Yards high, on whose Bricks were pourtray’d, before
they were burn’d, all kinds of living Creatures, with
great Art and curious Painting, particularly a general
Hunting of all sorts of wild Beasts, each Beast being
four Cubits high: Among these was <i>Semiramis</i> on
Horseback, striking a Leopard thro’ with a Dart, and
near her <i>Ninus</i> her Husband peircing a Lion with his
Lance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the middle of the City she built a Temple to
<i>Jupiter Belus</i> of exceeding great height,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Temple of <i>Belus</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by the advantage
of which, the <i>Chaldean</i> Astrologers observ’d the
setting and rising of the Stars. Upon the top of
it she plac’d three Statues of <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Juno</i> and <i>Rhea</i>,
all of beaten Gold. That of <i>Jupiter</i> was about 40
Foot high, and <i>Juno</i> held in her hand a Scepter adorn’d
with precious Stones. These three Statues weigh’d 2830
<i>Babylonish</i> Talents, and for these Deities, there were
plac’d on an Altar of beaten Gold, 40 Cubits long
and 15 broad, Censors, Cups and Drinking-Bowls of
Gold likewise, weighing at least 3230 Talents. Besides
the richness of this City, it was so vast and
great that <i>Aristotle</i> said, it ought rather to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>call’d a Country, adding withal, that when the Town
was taken, it was three Days before the farthest part
had notice of it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Pensil Garden</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Here likewise was the <i>Pensil Garden</i> so much fam’d,
being 400 Foot square, with an ascent to it like to the
top of a Mountain, and having Buildings and Apartments
out of one into another, like a Theatre. Under
the Steps of the Ascent were Arches, gradually rising
one above another, and supporting the whole
Building, the highest Arch upon which the Platform
of the Garden was laid being 50 Cubits high, and the
Garden it self surrounded with Battlements and Walls
22 Foot in thickness. The whole Fabric was floor’d
over with massy Stones, 16 Foot long and 4 broad,
and these again cover’d with Reeds run over with <i>Bitumen</i>,
upon which were laid double Tiles, set together
with hard Plaster, and those cover’d with Sheet-Lead,
that the wet which should drain thro’ the Earth
might not rot the Foundation. Upon all these was
laid Earth of a convenient depth, which was planted
with all sorts of Trees, that for largeness and beauty
might delight the Spectators. The Arches had in
them many stately Rooms of all kinds, and for all
purposes; one of these had a certain Engin, that drew
plenty of Water out of the River for watering the
Garden, after such manner as none above knew how
it was done. This Garden was built in latter Ages
by <i>Cyrus</i>, at the request of a <i>Persian</i> Courtesan, who,
coveting Meadows on the tops of Mountains, desir’d
the King, by an artificial Plantation, to imitate the
Land in <i>Persia</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Semiramis</i> built other Cities on the Banks of <i>Euphrates</i>
and <i>Tigris</i>, and likewise caus’d a great Stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>to be cut out of the Mountains of <i>Armenia</i>, 125 Foot
in length and 5 in breadth and thickness, which she
convey’d to the River by the help of many yokes of
Oxen and Asses, and there putting it on board a Ship,
brought it to <i>Babylon</i>, where she set it up in the most
remarkable Place, as a wonderful Spectacle to all Beholders.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Obelisk</i> of <i>Semiramis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This from its shape was term’d an <i>Obelisk</i>,
signifying in <i>Greek</i>, a <i>Spit</i>, and accounted, says <i>Diodorus</i>,
one of the seven Wonders of the World; from
whence we have a very good Argument, that the
<i>Egyptian Obelisks</i> were cut out of Rocks or Quarries,
and not cast as some have suppos’d. <i>Semiramis</i> having
finish’d these Works, went to the Mountain <i>Bagistan</i>
in <i>Media</i>, which is 17 Furlongs from top to bottom,
and there caus’d her own Image to be carv’d on
the side of the Rock, and 100 of her Guards with
Lances round about her. She also made a Garden
on the middle of an exceeding high Rock, and built
therein stately Houses of Pleasure, from whence she
might have both a delightful Prospect into her Garden,
and view her Army encamp’d below on the Plain:
Likewise that she might leave behind her a lasting Monument
of her Name, she in a short Time, yet at vast
expence, made a shorter Passage towards <i>Ecbatana</i>,
for by hewing down the Rocks, and filling up the
Valleys, she laid that Way open and plain, which to this
Day is call’d <i>Semiramis</i>’s <i>Way</i>. She plentifully supply’d
<i>Ecbatana</i> with wholsome Waters, by means of a Canal
she dug, 15 Foot over and 40 Foot deep, beginning
from the foot of the Mountain <i>Orontes</i>, and as
she went thro’ <i>Persia</i> and <i>Asia</i>, she plain’d all along
the way before her, levelling both Rocks and Mountains.
On the other hand, in Champagne Countries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>she rais’d Eminences, whereon she either built Towns
and Cities, or else Sepulchres for her Officers and
great Commanders. Many other wonderful Things
were done by this Queen, which seem to exceed common
Belief; but as for those more admirable Works
of the <i>Egyptians</i>, <cite>Herodotus</cite>, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, <i>Strabo</i>,
<i>Pliny</i> and others are full of Relations of what they
have been, and the present Remains of some of them
at <i>Rome</i> are sufficient Arguments to evince there were
such, so that we should but loose Time in endeavouring
to prove that which we now hope every one is
satisfied of. Our next business therefore, must be to
enquire how these Arts came first to be found out,
and by what means they were accomplish’d and
brought to so great Perfection: What these Arts and
Sciences were, suppos’d by Authors to have been
found out by the <i>Egyptians</i>, I have already shown
else-where, so shall here only add, that <i>Hermes</i> or <i>Mercury</i>
is reported by <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> and other Writers,
to have been the chief Inventor of them; but as no
<i>Art</i> was ever invented and compleated at one Time, so
neither was it ever invented and perfected by one Person
so far, but another could add somewhat more
commodious or advantagious to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, as to the first Invention of Things, I shall
consider these three principal Causes:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Arts</i> how first Invented.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>First</i>, <i>Necessity</i>
is said to have been the <i>Mother</i> of Invention, by reason
it puts Mens Minds upon thinking how to supply
their Wants, with such Things, and after such manner
as they have most occasion for. <i>Secondly</i>, <i>Unexpected
Experiments</i>, as when you aim and try to find
out one Thing, and accidentally light on another:
Thus ’tis said <i>Gun-Powder</i> and divers other considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Things have been found out by Chance, and innumerable
others by experimental <i>Chymistry</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>,
<i>Natural Philosophy</i>, or Observation of the Instincts
of all living Creatures, has suggested many noble
Thoughts and Fancies to Men, both for Imitation and
Invention. Now tho’ we cannot assert that Men at
first learn’d <i>Architecture</i> from the <i>Beaver</i>, which builds
himself a House for shelter and security in the Winter
Time, yet are we certain they took the several
Ornaments of Building either from Birds, Beasts and
Fishes, or from the Leaves, Flowers and Fruits of Plants.
Thus the <i>Grecians</i> generally us’d the Leaves of <a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a><i>Acanthus</i>,
and the <i>Jews</i> those of Palm-Trees and Pomegranates
in their Buildings. Nor is it less probable their
Weaving might be found out from the Spider or Silk-Worm,
than that the Fish call’d <i>Nautilus</i>, or the little
Mariner, was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Navigiorum Archetipus</span></i>, the first Type
or Pattern of a Ship, who when he is to Swim, contracts
his Body and Finns into the form of a Galley
under Sail. From the sight whereof, some (as <i>Pliny</i>
conceives) took the first hint of framing a Ship, as
from the sight of a Kite flying in the Air, who turns
and steers his Body with his Tail (as Fishes also do in
the Water) some have devis’d the Stern and Rudder
of a Ship. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iidem videntur Artem gubernandi docuisse
Caudæ flexibus, in Cælo monstrante Natura quod opus
esset in profundo</span></i>, Pliny <i>Lib.</i> 10. cap. 10. <i>They seem to
have taught Men the Art of Steering a Ship by the flexures
of their Tails, Nature shewing in the Air what was
needful to be done in the Deep.</i> ’Tis also observ’d by
that great <i>Naturalist</i> Mr. <i>Ray</i>, that the Trunk of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Bird’s Body does somewhat resemble the Hull of a Ship,
the Head the Prow, which is for the most part small,
that it may the more easily cut the Air, and the Tail
serves to steer, govern and direct its flight. We read
there was a Beast in <i>Egypt</i> call’d <i>Cynocephalus</i>, of a very
strange kind, kept in the Temple of <i>Serapis</i>, which,
during the Time of the two Equinoxes, made Water
12 Times in a Day, and as often in the Night, regularly
and at even Spaces of Time; from the Observation
of which, they divided the Natural Day into 24
Hours, that Beast being as it were their Clock and
Dial, both to divide their Day, and reckon their
Hours by. This probably gave <i>Ctesibius</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>
an hint to invent the <i>Clepsydræ</i> or Water Glasses,
which distinguish’d the Hours by the fall or dropping
of Water, as <i>Clepsammidiæ</i> or Sand-Glasses did by the
running of Sand; and to shew they ow’d the Invention
of these Water-Glasses to the <i>Cynocephalus</i>, they us’d
to carve one on the top of them, as may be seen in
<i>Kircher</i> in <i>Mechanica Ægyptiaca</i>. Now <i>Egypt</i> was both
in respect of its Scituation as well as natural production
of curious Things, a mighty help to the Invention
and improvement of Arts and Sciences; for as <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Casalius
de veter. Ægypt. Ritibus</span></cite>, p. 35. tells us, <i>Arithmetic</i> was first
found out by their great Commerce, and <i>Geometry</i> from
the River <i>Nile</i>’s Annual over-flowing the Fields, and
removing their Bound-Marks, which occasion’d great
Disputes among them, so that by the frequent measuring
of the Ground it was deriv’d into this Art.
And as for <i>Astrology</i>, the quality of the Climate and
scituation of the Country was such, as gave them an
advantage above others, more clearly to discern the
rising and setting of the Stars, for by reason of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>perpetual Serenity of the Air, they found out the
Course of the Sun, Moon and Stars, with their Constellations,
Aspects and Influences, and moreover by
their often Worshipping those Planets, beheld and
contemplated them more seriously, and from thence
became the most skillful <i>Astrologers</i> in the World, as
<cite>Firmianus Divin. instit.</cite> Lib. 2. cap. 14. says: Hereby
also being made more perspicacious, and observing of
natural Things, they invented <i>Physick</i>, for, as <i>Prosper
Alpinus</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Physic</i>, how first found out.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Lib. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Medicina Ægyptiorum</span></cite> reports, They
took the hints of curing divers Diseases from brute
Beasts and Animals. Thus <i>Phlebotomy</i> or Bleeding
was found out from the <i>Hippopotomos</i> or River-Horse,
which lives in the <i>Nile</i>, for when this Beast is grown
over fat with continual Gluttony and Gormandizing,
he searches out for a sharp pointed Reed on the Banks of
the River, and having found one fit for his purpose,
sticks it into his Thigh, and wounds a certain Vein
there; when having sufficiently emty’d his Plethoric
Body by Bleeding, he closes, and as it were plasters up
the Orifice with Mud. Also that a certain Bird call’d
<i>Ibis</i>, about the Banks of <i>Nile</i>, first taught the <i>Egyptians</i>
the way of administring <i>Clysters</i>; for this Bird
has been often observ’d, by means of his crooked Bill
intromitted into the <i>Anus</i>, to inject salt Water, as
with a Syringe, into its own Bowels, and thereby to
exonerate its Paunch when too much obstructed.
Dogs are commonly known when Sick to Vomit
themselves by eating Grass. Swine, so soon as they
perceive themselves ill, refuse their Meat, and so recover
by Abstinence. ’Tis reported the wild Goat
taught the use of the <i>Dictamnus</i>, for drawing out of
Darts and healing Wounds, and the Swallow the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of <i>Celandine</i> for recovering the Sight; whence we
may as well infer, that from the diversity of Bodies,
such as Flies, Spiders, Gnats, Bees, Pismires, Grashoppers,
Locusts, Frogs, <i>&amp;c.</i> inclos’d in Amber, the <i>Egyptians</i>
might first learn the Art of <i>Embalming</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but
since these things appear rather Fabulous, and the pleasant
Flights of acute Wits and inquisitive Naturalists,
than solid Truths to be rely’d on, we must have recourse
to the fourth <i>Cause</i>, <i>viz.</i> That their Opinion of
the <i>Metemsychosis</i> or Transmigration of the Soul, and
other such like religious Principles, first oblig’d them
to study this Art, and perhaps the known Virtues of
<i>Opobalsamum</i>, so good against Mortifications and Putrifactions,
might suggest to them the use of it in preserving
the Bodies of Princes, as the Balsamic, Sulphurous
and Bituminous Nature of their <i>Asphalt</i>, taught
them to use that for the poorer sort of People; besides,
whatever way it was first found out, it was as easie for
them to do it as for us to believe it, says <i>Gabriel Clauderus</i>
in <cite>Methodo Balsamandi</cite>, p. 41. because they excell’d all
other Nations in Learning and Invention, so that by
applying themselves with the utmost diligence to the
study of this Art, they could not fail of attaining the
perfection of it, especially since this Region was, above
all others, the best accommodated with an extraordinary
fruitfulness and plenty of Aromatic and Medicinal
Things, necessary as well for all Physical Uses as for
the decent performing of their <i>Embalmings</i>. Now
<cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 38. tells us abundance of Practitioners in
Physic are frequently invited to <i>Cairo</i> by the great
store of Simples there growing. Add to this the extraordinary
Diligence of the <i>Egyptian</i> Kings and Priests,
both in rewarding Arts and being solicitously intent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>on finding out the Nature of Things themselves, not by
indulging Superstition, but by a strict search and scrutiny,
not trusting to plausible Appearances, but only to
Experiments and Demonstration. To prove this we
shall show such infallible Methods for the Invention
and Improvement of all Arts and Sciences, that they
could not easily miscarry in their Designs; for besides
the famous Library of <i>Ptolemy Philadelphus</i>, and that
in the Temple of <i>Serapis</i>, there was at <i>Cairo</i>, as <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prosper
Alpinus de Medicina Ægyptiorum</span></cite> relates, a University
or place of Study call’d <i>Gemelhazar</i>, which paid yearly
out of the public Stock of the Academy 300000 pieces
of Gold for Books, Food, Stipends, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. ’Tis said the Ornaments of the <i>Corinthian</i> Chapiter were invented from seeing a Maid rest
her Basket on a Tomb over-grown with this Plant; of which see <i>Vitruvius</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Invention of Arts and Sciences may be partly imputed
to the goodness of their Laws,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Goodness of their <i>Laws</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and their strictness
in observing them; the <i>Egyptians</i> alledging this as an
undeniable Argument, that the best Laws were made
and instituted among them, in that the Native Kings
had Reign’d in <i>Egypt</i> for the space of above 4700
Years, and that their Country during all that Time had
been the most prosperous and flourishing in the World,
which could never have been so if the Inhabitants had
not been civiliz’d and brought up under good Laws,
and a liberal Education in all kinds of Arts and Sciences.
To effect this therefore they divided their People into
three Orders: <i>First</i>, Priests. <i>Secondly</i>, Artificers and
Husbandmen. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, Military Persons or Souldiers.
Now each Person strictly keeping to his own
Province, Art flourish’d in a right Line, and Sciences
were not attack’d by rustic and ignorant Pretenders,
but only practis’d by Priests, who were the chief
of their Nobility, and liv’d separate from all others
least their Learning should be any ways divulg’d. Nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>was it lawful for any but Priests Sons to enter the Colleges
where these Sciences were taught, whereby the more
polite Knowledge was secur’d to the Priests, and mechanic
Arts and Trades practis’d only by the inferior
People. Now the better to effect and propagate this,
they had three Laws that mightily encourag’d the Study
and Invention of Arts, on which their chief Felicity
depended, as <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> witnesses. <i>First</i>, In that
they honour’d and esteem’d all such as were the first
Inventors and Promoters of useful Things. <i>Secondly</i>,
In that he who pretended to more Arts than one, incurr’d
a most grievous Punishment. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, In
that every one was oblig’d to appear annually before
the Governour of the Province to show how he got
his Living, which if he could not prove, or was found
to subsist by unjust means, he was infallibly punish’d
with Death. Thus all Men were employ’d,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Arts</i> most flourishing in the Reign of <i>Amasis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and every
Art carry’d to the highest perfection in the Reign of
<i>Amasis</i>, who enacted the third Law. Now, as a further
Argument of the <i>Egyptian</i> Industry, hear what
<i>Fl. Vopiscus</i> relates of the <i>Alexandrians</i>: <i>Civitas</i>, says
he, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">[Alexandria] opulenta, dives, fæcunda, in qua Nemo
vivit otiosus, alii Vitrum conflant, ab aliis Charta conficitur,
alii Linyphiones sunt: Omnes certe cujuscunque
Artis &amp; videntur &amp; habentur; Podagrosi quod agant habent,
habent cæci quod faciant, ne Chiragrici quidem
apud eos otiosi vivunt</span></i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Alexandria</i>, how Industrious and Flourishing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Alexandria <i>is a plentiful and
opulent City, in which none live idle: Some blow Glass,
others make Paper, a third sort weave Linnen, and in a
word, all have some Trade or Work. Those that have the
Gout in their Feet or are Blind have something to do, and
even such as have the Gout in their Hands are not idle.</i>
This shows how every Art was cultivated: Likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>their Industry and number of Hands as plainly prove
the facility of performing those seemingly incredible
and stupendious Works, which has taken us up
so much Time to relate; for ’tis said, throughout the
whole Country of <i>Egypt</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Egypt</i>, its number of Cities and Inhabitants.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in the Reign of <i>Amasis</i>,
there were reckon’d no fewer than 20000 Cities, and
that it was esteem’d the most populous Country of the
World. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> tells us it had in it above
18000 Cities, as might be seen register’d in their Sacred
Records; and in the Time of <i>Ptolemeus Lagus</i>
there remain’d above 3000. Once, they say, in a
general <i>Census</i> taken of all the Inhabitants, they amounted
to Seven Millions, and even at the Time of
<i>Diodorus</i>, there were no less than Three Millions of
People,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How it came to be so numerous.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which wonderful Encrease some think might
be effected by the constant drinking of the <i>Nile</i> Water,
which had the Virtue of making the <i>Egyptian</i>
Women Prolific, so as commonly to bring forth three
or four Children at a Birth. This may a little abate
the wonder, how the Children of <i>Israel</i> could multiply
to that degree in so short a space, that in 430
Years, from 70 Persons, which came with <i>Jacob</i> into
<i>Egypt</i>, he became a mighty Nation; for it is said, at
their departure, there journey’d, from <i>Rameses</i> to
<i>Succoth</i>, about 600000 Men, besides Women and
Children. Now how populous the Land from whence
they came was, may be collected not only from their
commanding such mighty Powers as were under them,
but also, as has been before observ’d, from the several
Accounts of that Kingdom, given us by <cite>Herodotus</cite>
and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>; for it is reported that <i>Sesac</i> or
<i>Sesonchis</i> arm’d 400000 Foot, 60000 Horse and 1200
Chariots against <i>Rehoboam</i>, and that King <i>Cheops</i> or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span><i>Chemnis</i> employ’d 360000 Men in erecting one of the
<i>Pyramids</i>. ’Tis also farther said, they built other stupendious
Works, such as the <i>Labyrinth</i>, <i>Obelisks</i>, <i>Colossus’s</i>,
&amp;c.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>By what Means such wonderful Works were perform’d,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as not knowing otherwise how to expend
their Treasure or employ their People, thro’ which
means their Kings, by their great Riches and infinite
numbers of Men, left behind them such eternal Monuments
of their State and Grandure, which altho’
they bear the name of <i>Wonders</i> to this very Day, as
seeming very difficult to have been perform’d, yet were
such Works render’d easie enough, if we consider so
vast a multitude of Hands as were employ’d about
them, and this being rightly consider’d, we may well
enough believe what <cite>Herodotus</cite> says of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>That it
had more wonderful Works than all the Nations of the
World besides</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and to what End.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus having shown how the <i>Egyptians</i> were the first
Inventors and Propagators of Arts and Sciences, we
will next show to what end they built those admirable
Structures with so great Labour and Expence, thinking
not as <i>Aristotle</i>, Lib. 3. <cite>Polit.</cite> who makes them to
have been the Works of Tyranny, or as <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 26.
cap. 12. conjectures, that they built them partly out
of Ostentation, and partly out of State-Policy, to divert
their People from Mutinies and Rebellion by keeping
them employ’d, but that they erected them as Repositories
for their Dead, which they did from a Belief
they had of the Immortality of the Soul, and an
Opinion they held of the Metempsychosis or Transmigration
of it from one Body to another: ’Tis true,
those Arguments alledg’d by <i>Pliny</i> might be Secondary
Motives, yet says <i>Greaves</i> in his <cite>Pyramidographia</cite>,
p. 45. the true Reason depends upon higher and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>weighty Considerations,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Theology</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>, or <i>Metempsychosis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
springing from the <i>Theology</i>
of the <i>Egyptians</i>, who as <i>Servius</i> shews in his Comment
on these words of <i>Virgil</i>, Lib. 3. <cite>Æneid.</cite> where
that Poet describes the Funeral of <i>Polydorus</i>,</p>

<p class='c009'>believ’d, <i>That as long as the Body endur’d so long should
the Soul continue with it</i>, which also was the Opinion
of the <i>Stoicks</i>: <i>Hence the</i> Egyptians, <i>skilful in Wisdom,
keep their Dead</i> embalm’d <i>so much the longer, to the end
the Soul may for a long while continue with the Body,
lest it should quickly pass into another. The</i> Romans
<i>acted quite contrary, burning their Dead, that the Soul
might suddenly return into the generality of Things, that
is, into its own Nature</i>; wherefore, says <i>Greaves</i>, that
the Body might not either by Putrifaction be reduc’d
to Dust, out of which it was first form’d, or by Fire
be converted to Ashes (as the manner of the <i>Greeks</i>
and <i>Romans</i> was) the <i>Egyptians</i> invented curious Compositions,
besides intombing their Dead in stately Repositories,
thereby to preserve them from Rottenness,
and render them Eternal. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec cremare, aut fodere fas
putant, verum arte Medicatos intra penetralia collocant</span></i>,
says <i>Pomponius Mela</i>, Lib. 1. cap. 9. Also <cite>Herodotus</cite> in
<i>Thalia</i> gives the Reason why they neither burn’d nor
bury’d their Dead, for discoursing in his third Book
of the Cruelty of <i>Cambyses</i>, and his commanding the
Body of <i>Amasis</i>, an <i>Egyptian</i> King, should be taken
out of his Sepulchre, be whipp’d and us’d with all contumely;
he reports, after all this he order’d it to be
burn’d, <i>Commanding that which was not Holy, for the</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Persians <i>imagin’d the Fire to be a God,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Fire</i> thought by the <i>Persians</i> a <i>God</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and neither the</i>
Egyptians <i>nor they were accustom’d to burn their Dead:
The</i> Persians, <i>for the Reason before alleg’d, because they
conceiv’d it unfit for a God to devour the Carcass of a
Man; and the</i> Egyptians, <i>because they were persuaded
the Fire was a living Creature,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>By the <i>Egyptians</i> a living Creature.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
devouring all Things it
receiv’d, and after it was satisfy’d with Food, dy’d with
that it had devour’d. Nor was it their Custom to give
their dead Bodies to Beasts (as the</i> Hyrcanians <i>were wont
to do) but to</i> Embalm <i>or Salt them, not only for this
Reason, but also that they might not be consum’d with
Worms</i>. The term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταριχεύειν</span>, i.&thinsp;e. <i>Salting</i> or <i>Embalming</i>
the Dead, us’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite>, is also us’d by <i>Baruch</i> and
<i>Plato</i>. <i>Lucian</i> likewise in his Discourse <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Luctu</span></cite>, treating
of the several kinds of Burial practis’d by divers
Nations, says, <i>The</i> Grecians <i>burn their Dead, the</i> Persians
<i>bury them, the</i> Indians <i>anoint them with the Fat
of Swine, the</i> Scythians <i>eat them, and the</i> Egyptians
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταριχεύει</span>) Embalm <i>them</i>: Which manner likewise is
alluded to by <i>M. Aurelius Antoninus</i>, under the word
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάριχος</span><a id='t239'></a>: His Words are these, <i>That which the other Day
was excrementitious Matter, shall within few Days either
be</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάριχος</span>, <i>an</i> Embalm’d <i>Body, or down right Ashes</i>;
in the one expressing the Custom of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
and in the other that of the <i>Romans</i>. By Salting or
<i>Embalming</i> the Soul, according to the Belief of the
<i>Egyptians</i>, was oblig’d to abide with the Body, and
the Body on its part became as durable as Marble, insomuch
that <i>Plato</i>, who liv’d in <i>Egypt</i> with <i>Eudoxus</i>
no less than 13 Years, as <i>Strabo</i> witnesses, brings it for
an Argument, in his <i>Phædon</i>, to prove the Immortality
of the Soul, thro’ the long duration of these Bodies,
which surely would have been yet more conclusive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>with him, could he but have imagin’d they should
have continu’d so solid and entire even to this Day,
as we find many of them are: <i>For this Reason St.</i>
Austin
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Egyptians</i> believ’d the <i>Resurrection</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>truly affirms the</i> Egyptians <i>had a Belief of the
Resurrection, in that they carefully preserv’d their Dead;
for they had a Custom among them of drying up the Bodies,
and rendring them as durable as Brass</i>: These, in their
Language they call’d <i>Gabbares</i>, whence the gloss of
<i>Isidore</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gabbares mortuorum in Vulcanius</span></i> his Edition, or
as <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spondanus de Cæmet. sacris</span></cite>, Lib. 1. pars 1. cap. 5. reads,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gabbares mortuorum condita Corpora</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The manner how the <i>Egyptians</i> prepar’d and <i>Embalm’d</i>
these Bodies is very copiously, and by what I
observ’d at my being there, says <i>Greaves</i> in his <cite>Pyramidographia</cite>,
p. 48. faithfully describ’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite> and
<i>Diodorus</i>; in which Matter, tho’ I cannot totally dissent
from Mr. <i>Greaves</i>, for their Account may be true,
yet is it not so copious as they make it, but imperfectly
related, or at least so far that some Passages are hardly
to be understood or made out, which may easily be allow’d
without Reflection on those famous Men, since
they treated of the Matter only as <i>Historians</i> and not
as <i>Physicians</i>: My business therefore shall be, after relating
their own Words, to reconcile their Differences,
explain the Difficulties, and compare the Opinions of
<i>Annotators</i> and <i>Physicians</i> on this <i>Art</i>, and lastly, to
suggest some new Thoughts, as plausible, and perhaps
as true as any, especially since it is all but guesswork,
and the true <i>Art</i> may have entirely perish’d with
the antient <i>Egyptians</i>, either by Inundation, Fire, Irruptions
of Enemies, or other hostile Devastations. I
will begin first with <cite>Herodotus</cite>, whose Words serve as
well to shew the several Ceremonies of <i>Sepulture</i> as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>their <i>Embalmings</i>, and whom we find in his Second Book
call’d <i>Euterpe</i>, thus speaking of the <i>Egyptians</i>:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Herodotus</cite>’s Account of the <i>Egyptian Funerals</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Their Mourning</i>, says he, <i>and manner of Burial are
after this kind: When any Man of Quality dies, all the
Women of that Family besmear their Heads and Faces
with Dirt; then leaving the Body at home, they go lamenting
up and down the City with all their Relations,
their Apparel being girt about them, and their Breasts
left naked. On the other hand the Men, having likewise
their Cloaths girt about them, beat themselves. These things
being done, they carry the dead Body to be</i> Embalm’d;
<i>for which, there are certain Persons appointed who profess
this</i> Art. <i>These, when the Body is brought to them,
shew to those that bring it certain Models of Wood, painted
like the Dead Person that is to be</i> Embalm’d. <i>One of these
they say is accurately made (which I think not lawful to
name;) then they shew a second inferior to it and of an
easier Price, and next a third cheaper than the former, and
of a very small value, which being seen, they ask them what
Pattern they will have the dead Body prepar’d by: When
they have agreed on the Price they depart, and those with
whom the dead Corps is left proceed to</i> Embalm <i>it after
the following manner: First of all they, with a crooked
Iron, draw the Brain out of the Head thro’ the Nostrils,
and then fill up the Cavity with Medicinal Ingredients.
Next, with a sharp</i> Æthiopic <i>Stone, they cut up that
part of the</i> Abdomen <i>call’d the</i> Ilia, <i>and that way draw
out all the Bowels, which having cleans’d and wash’d
with Palm-Wine, they again rinse and wash with Wine
perfum’d with pounded Odours; then filling up the Belly
with pure</i> Myrrh <i>and</i> Cassia <i>grosly powder’d, and all other
Odours except</i> Frankincense, <i>they sow it up again. Having
so done, they salt it up close with Nitre 70 Days,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>for longer they may not salt it. After this number of Days
are over, they wash the Corps again, and then roul it up
with fine Linnen all besmear’d with a sort of Gum commonly
us’d by the</i> Egyptians <i>instead of Glue. Then is the Body
restor’d to its Relations, who prepare a wooden Coffin for
it, in the shape and likeness of a Man, and then put the</i>
Embalm’d <i>Body into it, and thus inclos’d place it in a
Repository in the House, setting it upright against the
Wall. After this manner they with great expence preserve
their Dead, whereas those who to avoid too great
a Charge desire a mediocrity, thus</i> Embalm <i>them: They
neither cut the Belly nor pluck out the Entrails, but
fill it with Clysters of Oil of</i> Cedar <i>injected up the</i>
Anus, <i>and then salt it the aforesaid number of Days. On
the last of these they press out the</i> Cedar <i>Clyster, by the
same way they had injected it, which has such Virtue and
Efficacy that it brings out along with it the Bowels wasted,
and the Nitre consumes the Flesh, leaving only the Skin
and Bones: Having thus done, they restore the dead Body to
the Relations, doing nothing more. The third way of</i>
Embalming <i>is for those of yet meaner Circumstances:
They with Lotions wash the Belly, then dry it with Salt
for 70 Days, and afterwards deliver it to be carry’d away.
Nevertheless, beautiful Women and Ladies of Quality
were not deliver’d to be</i> Embalm’d <i>till three or four Days
after they had been dead</i>. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ea de causa facientes, ne cum
Fæminis isti Salinarii concumbant. Deprehensum enim
quendam aiunt coeuntem cum recenti Cadavere Muliebri,

Egyptian <i>or Stranger was either kill’d by a Crocodile, or
drown’d in the River, the City where he was cast up was
to</i> Embalm <i>and bury him honourably in the Sacred Monuments,
whom no one, no, not a Relation or Friend, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Priests of</i> Nile <i>only might touch, because they bury’d one
who was something more than a dead Man</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Diodorus Siculus</i>’s Account of the <i>Egyptian Funerals</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib. 1. relates the Funeral Ceremonies
of the <i>Egyptians</i> more distinctly and clearly,
and with some very remarkable Circumstances. <i>When
any one among the</i> Egyptians <i>dies</i>, says he, <i>all his Relations
and Friends, putting Dirt upon their Heads, go
lamenting about the City, till such time as the Body shall
be bury’d. In the mean time they abstain from Baths and
Wine, and all kinds of delicate Meats, neither do they
during that time wear any costly Apparel. The manner
of their Burials is threefold; one very costly, a second sort
less chargable, and a third very mean. In the first</i>, they
say, <i>there is spent a Talent of Silver, in the second 20</i>
Minæ, <i>but in the last there is very little Expence. Those
who have the care of ordering the Body, are such as have
been taught that Art by their Ancestors. These shewing
to the Kindred of the Deceas’d a Bill of Expences of
each kind of Burial, ask them after what manner they
will have the Body prepar’d; when they have agreed upon
the matter, they deliver the Body to such as are usually
appointed for this Office. First he who has the
name of Scribe, laying it upon the Ground, marks about
the Flank on the left side, how much is to be cut away.
Then he who is call’d the Cutter or Dissector, with an</i> Æthiopic
<i>Stone, cuts away as much of the Flesh as the Law
commands, and presently runs away as fast as he can:
Those who are present persuing him, cast Stones at him, and
curse him, hereby turning all the Execrations, which they
imagin due to his Office, upon him. For whosoever offers
violence, wounds or does any kind of injury to a Body of
the same nature with himself they think him worthy of
Hatred; but those who are call’d the</i> Embalmers, <i>they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>esteem worthy of Honour and Respect: For they are familiar
with their Priests, and go into the Temples as Holy
Men, without any prohibition. So soon as they come
to</i> Embalm <i>the dissected Body, one of them thrusts his
Hand thro’ the Wound into the</i> Abdomen, <i>and draws
forth all the Bowels but the Heart and Kidnies, which
another washes and cleanses with Wine made of Palms
and aromatic Odours. Lastly, having wash’d the Body,
they anoint it with Oil of Cedar and other Things for
above 30 Days, and afterwards with Myrrh, Cinamon
and other such like Matters; which have not only a power
to preserve it for a long Time, but also give it a sweet
Smell; after which they deliver it to the Kindred, in such
manner that every Member remains whole and entire, and
no part of it chang’d, but the beauty and shape of the
Face seems just as it was before, and may be known, even
the Hairs of the Eye-Lids and Eye-Brows remaining as
they were at first. By this means many of the</i> Egyptians,
<i>keeping the dead Bodies of their Ancestors in magnificent
Houses, so perfectly see the true Visage and Countenance of
those that dy’d many Ages before they themselves were born,
that in viewing the Proportions of every one of them, and
the Lineaments of their Faces, they take as much delight
as if they were still living among them. Moreover, the
Friends and nearest Relations of the Deceas’d, for the
greater Pomp of the Solemnity, acquaint the Judges and
the rest of their Friends with the Time prefix’d for the
Funeral or Day of Sepulture, declaring that such a one
(calling the Dead by his Name) is such a Day to pass
the Lake, at which Time above 40 Judges appear, and
sit together in a Semicircle, in a place prepar’d on the
hither side of the Lake, where a Ship, provided before-hand
by such as have the care of the Business, is hal’d up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the Shoar, and steer’d by a Pilot, whom the</i> Egyptians <i>in
their Language call</i> Charon. <i>Hence, they say</i>, Orpheus
<i>upon seeing this Ceremony while he was in</i> Egypt, <i>invented
the Fable of Hell, partly imitating therein the People
of</i> Egypt, <i>and partly adding somewhat of his own. The
Ship being thus brought to the Lake-side, before the Coffin
is put on board, every one is at liberty by the Law to accuse
the Dead of what he thinks him guilty. Now if
any one proves he was an ill Liver, the Judges give Sentence
the Body shall be depriv’d of Sepulture; but in case
the Informer be convicted of false Accusation, then is he severely
punish’d. If no Accuser appear, or the Information
prove false, then all the Kindred of the Deceas’d leave off
Mourning, and begin to set forth his Praises, yet say nothing
of his Birth (as the Custom is among the</i> Greeks) <i>because
the</i> Egyptians <i>all think themselves equally Noble: But
then they recount how the Deceas’d was educated from his
Youth, and brought up to Man’s Estate, exalting his Piety
towards the Gods and Justice towards Men, his Chastity
and other Virtues, wherein he excell’d; and lastly, pray and
call upon the Infernal Deities to receive him into the Society
of the Just. The common People take this from the
others, and consequently approve all is said in his Praise
by a loud shout, setting likewise forth his Virtues in the
highest strains of Commendation, as one that is to live for
ever with the Infernal Gods. Then those that have Tombs
of their own, interr the Corps in places appointed for that
purpose, and they that have none, rear up the Body in its
Coffin against some strong Wall of their House. But such
as are deny’d Sepulture on account of some Crime or Debt,
are laid up at home without Coffins: Yet when it shall afterwards
happen that any of their Posterity grows Rich,
he commonly pays off the deceas’d Persons Debts, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>gets his Crimes absolv’d, and so buries him honourably, for
the</i> Egyptians <i>are wont to boast of their Parents and Ancestors
that were magnificently bury’d. ’Tis a Custom likewise
among them to pawn the dead Bodies of their Parents
to their Creditors, but then those that do not redeem them
fall under the greatest Disgrace imaginable, and are deny’d
Burial themselves at their Deaths.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reflections on the <i>Egyptian Embalming</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus far <cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> have given
the largest and clearest Accounts of any of the Ancients
of the Funeral Ceremonies and <i>Embalmings</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
but there are still remaining some dubious and
difficult Points necessary to be known, for the better
understanding this <i>Art</i>: We shall make some Quere’s
and Reflexions thereon, and endeavour to reconcile
them by the Opinions of the more refin’d Artists, the
modern Physicians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Mourning</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>First then of the Mourning of the <i>Egyptians</i>, by
them very strictly observ’d for a long time, and perform’d
after the following manner: When any of
their Kings dy’d they lamented his Death with a general
Mourning, making sad Lamentations, putting Dirt
upon their Heads, rending their Cloaths and beating
their Breasts; they shut up their Temples and Markets,
and prohibited all Festivals and Rejoycings; they abstain’d
from all delicate Meats and costly Apparel, from
Baths, Perfumes and Ointments, and neither made
their Beds nor accompany’d with their Wives, but
express’d all the signs of an extraordinary Affliction,
that they could have done for their own Child. This
their Mourning continu’d till the Body was bury’d,
which was no less than 72 Days, during which, both
Men and Women, and those about 2 or 300 in number,
went about the City twice a Day without any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>thing on but a Linnen-Cloath girt about their Bodies,
from beneath their Breasts downwards, renewing their
Grief, and intermixing the Virtues and Praises of the deceas’d
Prince with their Sighs and Outcries. Much the
same Ceremonies were observ’d in their private Funerals,
some of which we shall insert from the Writings of
the famous <i>Don Antonio de Guevara</i>, Historiographer to
the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. who in his 10th Letter, English’d
by Mr. <i>Savage</i>, thus writes: ‘Of all Nations,
none we read of made so much adoe about their
Dead as the <i>Egyptians</i>, who, when ever a Friend dy’d,
always shew’d him far more Respect than while he
liv’d; insomuch that if a Father lost a Son, a Son a
Father, or one Friend was depriv’d of another, they
us’d to shave off half their Hair as a <i>Hieroglyphic</i> to
demonstrate they had parted with half of themselves.
Also the <i>Egyptian</i> Women, when their Husbands,
Children or Relations dy’d, were wont to tear their
Flesh, and scratch their Faces with their Nails. Likewise
the lesser Priests, at the Funerals of the greater,
were accustom’d to mark their Flesh with red hot
Irons, either on their Hands, Arms or Breasts, to the
end that when ever they beheld those Scars they might
immediately be dispos’d to lament their loss. In
like manner they had a Custom, that when ever a
King or Prince dy’d, all his Officers were instantly
oblig’d to slash themselves with Knives in some visible
part of their Bodies; insomuch, that he who was
observ’d to have most Wounds, was always look’d
upon to be the greatest Mourner. All which Ceremonies
being in themselves superstitious, and no
doubt invented by the Devil, forasmuch as the <i>Egyptians</i>
were all naturally Necromancers, Magicians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Wizzards and Astrologers, and for that they were
not only a damage to the Living, but also no Advantage
to the Dead; <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> forbad the Children of
<i>Israel</i> (who living so long in <i>Egypt</i>, had contracted
many ill Customs from those People) both marking
and cutting their Flesh, as appears from <i>Leviticus</i> 19.
27, 28. where he Commands the <i>Israelites</i> neither
to <i>round the Corners of their Heads, nor mar the Points
of their Beards: To make any Cuttings in their Flesh,
or print any Marks upon it on account of their Dead</i>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How the <i>Egyptians Embalm’d Bodies</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus <cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> having first
describ’d the manner of <i>Mourning</i> among the <i>Egyptians</i>,
they next proceed to give an Account of their
<i>Embalmings</i>, telling us, That whilst the Ceremonies of
<i>Mourning</i> were performing, they carry’d the Dead to
be <i>Embalm’d</i>, as I suppose, to a certain place appointed
for that purpose, where Persons resided who profess’d
that Art, being well experienc’d therein, and
taught it by their Ancestors. These show’d the Relations
or Persons that brought the Body, and had
commission for ordering the Funeral, certain Models
or Patterns of Wood, painted in the likeness
of <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Three different kinds of <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
being of three several kinds and
Prizes, suitable to every one’s Condition and Quality;
some very Rich and Costly, others of a moderate Price,
and a third sort cheaper and of very little Value. Having
agreed upon the Sort and Price, they immediately
go about <i>Embalming</i> the Body, and as <cite>Herodotus</cite>
tells us, first of all draw out the Brain, with a crooked
Iron, thro’ the Nostrils, infusing in its place, by the
same way, several Medicaments, which as it is contrary
to our Custom of Dissection, that begins with
the <i>Abdomen</i>, seeing its Contents soonest putrifie and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>become offensive even in our cold Country, and
much more would do in so hot a Climate as that of
<i>Egypt</i>, if neglected; so the extraction of the Brain,
after the manner propos’d by him, is a very difficult
and tedious piece of Work, if possible to be perform’d at
all; but his wrong beginning of this Work of <i>Embalming</i>
is not so material a Mistake, as his amusing us
with a Story of drawing forth the Brain thro’ the
Nostrils with a crooked Iron, (by which I suppose he
means some particular sort of Instrument) and not
farther explaining himself how or after what manner
it was done; and indeed I believe he could not, the
thing being in it self impracticable and ridiculous,
which any one skill’d in <i>Anatomy</i> will readily agree to.
But grant it could be done, the afore-said extraction
of the Brain thro’ the Nostrils, must nevertheless so
dilacerate the cartilagineous parts of the Nose, that
the carnous and cutaneous parts would sink, and
thereby render the Face deform’d. More agreeable
therefore to Reason is what <i>Gryphius</i> in <cite>Tract. de Mum.
Wratislav.</cite> p. 45. asserts, That it might be more commodiously
extracted thro’ a large <i>Foramen</i>, made in
the hinder part of the Head, near the upper <i>Vertebræ</i>
of the Neck; but that this was not the right way
neither, I am thoroughly convinc’d from the Skull of
an <i>Embalm’d</i> Body I have by me, which has no such
Apertion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Brain</i> how extracted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To reconcile therefore this seeming difficulty,
I will shew a Method how ’tis possible to be
perform’d by a convenient Instrument which I have
devis’d, and intend to describe in another Place, contenting
my self here to tell you, That by injecting
Oil of <i>Cedar</i>, or the like corrosive Medicine thro’
the Nostrils, or thro’ the Ears, by a Passage privately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>made into the Skull, the Brain may be consum’d and
brought away, and the Skull, by injections of spirituous
and aromatic Wines, be thoroughly wash’d and
cleans’d; and lastly fill’d with melted <i>Bitumen</i> or sweet
Balsams, that acquire a solid Consistence when cold.
And altho’ <i>Greaves</i> seems well satisfy’d with <cite>Herodotus</cite>’s
Account, yet is his Observation, <i>p.</i> 49. of his
<i>Pyramidographia</i>, more agreeable to this Opinion of
mine, where he tells us, That having caus’d the Head
of one of the richer sort of <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies to be
open’d, he found in the hollow of the Skull the quantity
of two pounds of Medicament, which had the
consistence, blackness and smell of a kind of <i>Bitumen</i>
or Pitch, and by the heat of the Sun was become soft.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Diodorus Siculus</i> begins more methodically with the
<i>Scribe</i> or <i>Designer</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Scribe</i> or <i>Designer</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
an Officer so call’d, who draws upon
a piece of Paper, or marks on the Body it self, the
part that was to be open’d, <i>viz.</i> The Flank on the left
side.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dissector.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then the <i>Dissector</i> made the Incision (<i>without
cutting off any of the Flesh, or running away so soon as he had
done</i>) and thrusting his Hand into the Belly, drew out
all the Guts, which, as <i>Plutarch</i> writes, were cast into
the River <i>Nile</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanquam inquinamenta Corporis</span></i>, as defiling
the Body: But <i>Diodorus</i> tells us, The Body was
embowell’d by one of the <i>Embalmers</i>, which altho’ it
appears to me a more filthy and detestable Work than
making the Incision,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalmers</i> much honour’d.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
yet he says the <i>Embalmers</i> were
highly honour’d and respected, being familiar with
the Priests, and entring into the Temples as Holy Men,
whereas he excludes the <i>Dissectors</i> from out of that
number, as performing an odious Operation hateful
to all Men. In this distinction however I am apt to
think he’s either intirely out, or has mistaken it for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>just the contrary; for, as we have already shown, <i>p.</i>
181. <i>Anatomy</i> was not only generally approv’d, but
likewise often perform’d by Holy and Great Men,
such as the <i>Egyptian</i> Priests and Kings, who would
either have practis’d or taught better, in case it had
been so heinous a Crime as this Author makes it;
whence, without doubt, those that did this pious and
necessary Office towards preserving the Dead, must
needs have been equally honour’d with the <i>Embalmers</i>,
and what seems yet clearly to confirm this, is that
sometimes the <i>Art of Embalming</i> has been call’d <i>Honesta
Anatomia</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the Instrument with which this Incision was
made was an <i>Ethiopic</i> Stone call’d <i>Basaltes</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Basaltes</i> an <i>Ethiopic</i> Stone.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and
nam’d from its hardness and colour like to Iron, that
word in the <i>Ethiopic</i> Language signifying Iron, and
this Stone being much harder than that Metal, it
might very probably be whet to a keen edge or point,
and so be ceremonially us’d instead of an Incision-Knife,
like as the antient <i>Jews</i> were wont to use Knives
made of Flints in their Circumcision, <i>Joshua</i> 5. 2.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Embowelling</i> a Corps.</div>

<p class='c009'>As to the Exenteration or Embowelling the Body,
we are not to imagine they drew out only the Brain
and Guts, but likewise the Lungs, Stomach, Liver,
Spleen, and other <i>Viscera</i>, except the Heart and Kidnies,
which being carnous and fleshy might very likely be
left, as being easier to be preserv’d than the moist
parts. The former they might probably leave to be
<i>Embalm’d</i>, as being the principal Bowel of the whole
Body, and source of vital Heat (wherefore it has been
frequently preserv’d apart by several People) but for
what Reason, or out of what Superstition they left the
latter I cannot readily conjecture.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Then having empty’d the Head, Breast and Belly of
their Contents, they first wash’d and cleans’d them
with Phænician or Palm-Wine, compounded of aromatic
Spices and sweet Odours,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Body</i> stuff’d with medicinal Ingredients.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and afterwards stuff’d
them with a mixture of sweet scented Drugs, Spices
and Balsams, such as <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i>, <i>Saffron</i>, <i>Cassia</i> or
<i>Cinamon</i>, <i>Opobalsamum</i> and the like, <i>Frankincense</i> only
being excepted, because that was by them consecrated
to their Gods. These Ingredients had not only a
power to preserve the Body for a long Time, but also
gave it a sweet and agreeable Smell. This done, they
sew’d up the Incision or Passage thro’ which they drew
forth the Bowels; but <i>Antonius Santorellus</i> in his <cite>Post-Praxis
Medica</cite>, p. 136. not without Reason observes,
That tho’ Aromatics are of a drying quality, yet as
they are likewise heating, they may occasion a Fermentation
in the Body; therefore I am apt to think <i>Myrrh</i>
and <i>Aloes</i> were the basis of the Composition, and
that Aromatics were us’d only in small quantities, and
that rather to conciliate a grateful Odour to the Body
than preserve it from Putrifaction. Yet I am not ignorant
at the same time of what some alledge of Aromatics,
that by their innate balsamic Virtue, by their
bitterness and oleaginous Sulphur, or penetrability of
their volatil Salts, they resist Putrifaction. Neither
am I ignorant of what <i>Bellonius</i> affirms, Lib. 2. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Medicato
Funere</span></cite>, p. 27. that neither <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i> nor
<i>Saffron</i> have so much Virtue as to consume the Humidity
of a dead Body, nor being hard Bodies can penetrate
so far as to enter the Bones and replete their Cavities.
Furthermore asserting, That if <i>Aloes</i> were us’d
in <i>Embalming</i> they would give the Body a bitter taste,
whereas no Mummies have been ever found to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>such a taste; and this is also taken notice of, says the
aforesaid Author, by <i>Valerius Cordus</i>, one who wrote
more truly of the <i>Mummies</i> than all the Physicians of
his Time had done: But I suppose both these Learned
Men spoke rather from their experience of common
Bodies, <i>Embalm’d</i> with <i>Cedar</i>, <i>Asphalt</i> or <i>Pissasphalt</i>,
than from the Bodies of Princes and rich Men, which
being <i>Embalm’d</i> after the best manner, with odoriferous
and aromatic Gums and Spices, had in that Composition
a mixture of fine <i>Aloes</i>, and this any one will
the readier grant, who considers the manner of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i> and <i>Cinnamon</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
antient <i>Jews</i> or <i>Hebrews</i> <i>Embalming</i> with <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i>
and <i>Cinamon</i>, which they learn’d of the <i>Egyptians</i> by
living so long among them, chiefly differing in this,
That the <i>Hebrews</i> Anointed or <i>Embalm’d</i> their Dead
without Exenteration, thereby intending only to render
the Body sweet and free from Putrifaction for a
short Time, or ’till its Burial, whereas the <i>Egyptians</i>
Embowell’d and <i>Embalm’d</i> theirs for Eternity. But
here still arises another Controversie, <i>viz.</i> What is to
be understood by the Word <i>Aloes</i> in Balsamation?
Whether <i>Agalochum</i> or <i>Lignum Aloes</i>, a Wood of a
very pleasant smell, or <i>Aloes</i>, an express’d Juice from
the Leaves of a Plant, a Gum of a strong Odour?
Most Annotators on the word <i>Aloes</i>, mention’d in
the Holy Scripture, as in <i>Prov.</i> 7. 17. <i>Cant.</i> 4. 14. <cite>John</cite>
19. 39. interpret it the <i>Wood Aloes</i>, being an excellent
sweet scented and aromatic Perfume; and since it is
also of a bitterish Taste, and indu’d with some balsamic
Qualities, ’tis not absur’d to think it was us’d together
with other Ingredients in <i>Embalming</i>, yet according
to a physical Judgment in this <i>Art</i>, we nevertheless
believe that <i>Aloes</i>, the Gum or inspissate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Juice of a Plant, so manifest for its extraordinary and
incomparable bitterness and efficacy to resist Putrifaction,
was one of the chief Ingredients in their Composition,
for otherwise the Scripture would have given
a more peculiar signification of the Word, to distinguish
the <i>Wood</i> from the <i>Gum</i>: So that he who determines
that both might have been apply’d, one to
correct the ill Savour of the other, may commit no
great Mistake, or at least if he thinks, that the <i>Wood</i>
was chiefly us’d in their perfuming Ointments, and
the <i>Gum</i> in their <i>Embalmings</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Body being stuff’d full of aromatic and sweet
Odours, they sew’d it up again, and then salted it
with <i>Nitre</i> for the space of 70 Days, as <cite>Herodotus</cite> relates;
yet <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> speaks nothing of this Salting,
but in its stead substitutes the manner of Anointing:
Both which Terms of <i>Salting</i> and <i>Anointing</i>
Authors confound one with another, and under the
same denomination express two different Operations
or Works, and yet seem to make them perform’d by
the same Persons: For those who are said to be the
<i>Embalmers</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Salters</i> or <i>Pollinctors</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
are call’d by some <i>Taricheutæ</i> or <i>Salitores</i>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a verbo</span></i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταριχεύειν</span><a id='t254'></a>, <i>Salire</i> or <i>Sale durare</i>, and by others
<i>Pollinctors</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab unguendis Cadaveribus quasi polluti, vel
a verbo pollingere, quod est, polliendo ungere, vel Pellem
ungere</span></i>, &amp;c. whose Office and Business was to exenterate
or embowel the Body, to wash and cleanse it,
and to salt and anoint it. These again, some say, were
much honour’d and respected, and others on the contrary,
That they were so abominated that they would
not suffer them to live in the City; which latter I am
most apt to believe, as performing a very vile and
servile Work, therefore might well be look’d upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>as polluted Persons. Who then were the true <i>Embalmers</i>,
properly so call’d, and had in most esteem,
I shall anon show; but must first proceed to speak of
their <i>Salination</i>, and the Virtues and Qualities of
<i>Nitre</i> and other Salts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nitre</i> why us’d in <i>Embalming</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>‘<i>Bellonius</i>, Lib. 3. cap. 8. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Medicato Funere</span></cite>, tells
us, the <i>Egyptians</i> and other <i>Eastern</i> Nations, attributed
very great Virtues to <i>Nitre</i> for preserving the
Carcasses of the Dead, and that notwithstanding
other Salts and Aromatics, endu’d with astringent
and exsiccating Qualities, might have the same Virtue,
yet since none were more efficacious, <i>Embalmers</i>
or Salters were wont chiefly to use <i>Nitre</i>. Those
both the <i>Greek</i> Historians and Physicians have sufficiently
describ’d, but since they so disagree about
this, I think it not improper to treat more particularly
of it. <i>First</i>, <cite>Herodotus</cite> tells us, The <i>Egyptians</i>
salted the dead Body 70 Days, and afterwards adds
the use and reason of it, because, says he, Salt consumes
the Flesh, and leaves nothing behind it but
Skin and Bones; whence it appears <i>Nitre</i> was in very
great esteem among them for preserving the Dead.
But now, says <i>Bellonius</i>, there is so great scarcity of
<i>Nitre</i> in <i>Europe</i>, that no Physician can say he has
ever seen the true, for certainly a Man may be as
well cheated in that Salt as in any Drugs now
commonly us’d. Some there are who promiscuously
use many Things instead of it, and others that
as erroneously assert there are two sorts of it, one
factitious and another natural, and I very much
wonder that several excellent Physicians should not
have taken notice, that the <i>Saltpetre</i> we now-a-days
use is not the true <i>Nitre</i>: Nor have any of the Ancients
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>distinguish’d <i>Nitre</i> into artificial and natural,
one made by Art, and the other a concrete Body
dug out of the Earth; for all <i>Nitre</i> is certainly made
by Art, after the manner of other Salts, and not
conceal’d in the Earth, but found above it. Nor is
there any native <i>Nitre</i> dug out of the Earth, altho’
it may be made from Water; for Rain-Water being
the purest, lightest and sweetest of all Waters,
makes the best <i>Nitre</i>; so likewise does the <i>Nile</i>-Water,
which from the force of its Mud, soon condenses
the <i>Nitre</i>. Now to know where <i>Nitre</i> may
be found, read <i>Theophrastus</i>, Lib. 3. cap. 22. who
gives this as a very plain Argument, That where
<i>Palm-Trees</i> grow in plenty, as they do in <i>Africa</i>,
<i>Syria</i>, and the like Countries, there the Soil will
always be Nitrous; for tho’ these Trees require the
circum-ambient Air to be hot, that their Fruits may
ripen, yet they nevertheless covet a salt Soil to refrigerate
their Roots; whence we may gather that
a Virtue in Earth to make <i>Nitre</i> is more wanting
than in Water: But in <i>Africa</i> <i>Nitre</i> was cheaper
than Salt, for tho’ Salt was both artificially made
and dug out of the Rock, yet by reason of a Tax
and Duty upon it, it was not so easie to be got as
<i>Nitre</i>, which naturally concreted in the Vallies, and
might be had without any Expence; wherefore the
<i>Arabians</i>, who liv’d not far from the Sea, and the
<i>Egyptians</i>, who had <i>Nitre</i> so cheap among them,
us’d it before Salt, which they were forc’d to seek
for and get in more remote Places; nay, they us’d
to eat <i>Nitre</i> with their Radishes and Pot-Herbs, after
the same manner as we now do Salt. And thus, so
soon as the Inhabitants had first made Trial of <i>Nitre</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>using it in their Bread, Pottage, Gruels, with their
Flesh and other Food, and finding it wholesom,
sought for no other Salt, but us’d <i>Nitre</i> in its stead,
and taught the neighbouring Countries to do the
like. But the <i>Macedonians</i> made their Bread with a
sort of <i>Nitre</i> call’d,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Chalastræum Nitrum.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Chalastræum Nitrum</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a Chalastra
Civitate</span></i>, Plin. 13. 10. a pure sort of <i>Saltpetre</i>, which,
for the most part, they rather chose to make use of
than Salt. <i>Nitre</i> took its rise in many parts of
<i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, but Authors know that of
one Country from another, by the goodness and badness
of it, tho’ <i>Nitre</i> in general be commended by
all,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nitrum Berenicum.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and <i>Galen</i> praises the <i>Nitre</i> of <i>Berenice</i> of <i>Pentapolis</i>
in <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Those Springs call’d by <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Fontes amari</i>, on
the Shoar of the <i>Red-Sea</i>, would have had but little
bitterness, had not the Soil been Nitrous. All the
Fountains likewise of <i>Arabia</i> are bitterish, by reason
of the nitrous Earth thro’ which they pass, and that
Lake near the City of <i>Chalastra</i> in <i>Macedon</i> affords
much <i>Nitre</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nitri spuma.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Authors call it <i>Nitri spuma</i>, <i>Aphronitrum</i>,
and by several other Names. <i>Galen</i> orders
this stony Matter first to be burn’d, and then levigated
to a Powder; whereby it plainly appears our
<i>Saltpetre</i> is not <i>Nitre</i>. There is nothing more frequently
mention’d by <i>Absyrtus</i>, in his Book of Farriery,
than <i>Nitre</i>; and it was also us’d by <i>Ganea</i>, and
the Skilful have observ’d many Things to grow tender
by <i>Nitre</i>, especially the Roots of Herbs, which
are also made whiter by it, and Coleworts and Pot-Herbs
greener.’ Some call the Flower of the <i>Lapis
Assius</i>, <i>Nitre</i>, a kind of Stone of which Coffins were
formerly made, which wasted dead Bodies: ‘But I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>would advise the Reader, says <i>Bellonius</i>, not to believe
that <i>Nitre</i>, which we speak of, to have any
affinity with the Salt commonly so call’d.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Armenian Nitre.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Avicenna</i>
prefers the <i>Armenian Nitre</i> before the <i>Egyptian</i>, and
<i>Dioscorides</i> very much praises the <i>Nitre</i> of <i>Buna</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nitre</i> of <i>Buna</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
common People daily use the <i>Nitre</i> of <i>Turkey</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nitre</i> of <i>Turkey</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
tho’
we are nevertheless ignorant whence it comes, and
there is nothing more common among the Merchants
of <i>Nitria</i>, <i>Memphis</i>, <i>Constantinople</i> and <i>Damascus</i>
than what they vulgarly call <i>Natron</i>. It
grows very plentifully in the <i>Eastern</i> Countries, and
is much us’d in Dying Silk and Wool. <i>Serapio</i> also
confounds <i>Borax</i>, which the Goldsmiths use, with
<i>Nitre</i>; but <i>Nitre</i> is truly made by the benefit of
the Soil and the force of the hot Sun, wherefore
’tis call’d by some of the <i>Greeks</i> <i>Halmirhaga</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Halmirhaga.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
deriving
its Name partly from its bitterish Taste, and
partly from its being got out of the Earth at <i>Nitria</i>,
a City of <i>Egypt</i>, so call’d from <i>Nitre</i>. At <i>Naucratis</i>
and <i>Memphis</i> there are places where <i>Nitre</i>
grows, and where the Water is pour’d into it like
Sea-Water into Salt-Pits. Between <i>Memphis</i> and <i>Jerusalem</i>
we saw a Desart concreted with <i>Nitre</i>, from
whence so great a quantity might be taken, that many
Ships might have been easily laden therewith;
which Desart, so concreted with <i>Nitre</i>, was longer
than half a Mile, and when I past by it in the Night-Time,
I thought it had been cover’d with Salt; and
when the Moon shon, it rebounded up to the Pupils
of my Eyes, and dazl’d them with its splendor. In
it Camels, Horses and Mules had left the impression
of their Footsteps, and when I lighted off my
Horse and had cut some of it up, I found it to be of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the same kind which I had before seen at <i>Memphis</i>.
<i>Nitre</i> therefore is not dug out of a Mountain, or
found in the Cavity of a Subterranean Den, or any
where cover’d with Earth, but gather’d up a concrete
Body from the surface of a Desart or solitary
Place, and is to be ascrib’d more to the Earth than
Water, by reason the Earth has there a kind of nitrous
Substance. When Rain, Fountain or the <i>Nile</i>-Water
has stood long in a Valley, it at length becomes
nitrous, by exhaling up to its self a salt Matter
or Substance from the bottom, which afterwards
concretes, with the heat of the Sun, and becomes
much harder than Salt. The whole mass of <i>Nitre</i>
is not concreted in one and the same Day, but gradually
and by degrees increases and becomes dry.
The first Concretion has no great thickness, but
when wet again with other Water, it adds by
little and little another Covering. This growing
harder and harder, so long concretes that it at last
becomes a Foot and half thick, by which it comes to
pass that the Face of the <i>Nitre</i> keeps a certain likeness
to crusted <i>Cadmia</i>; for the whole Mass consists
of right courses in equal Circles, and is not divided
by intricate Windings, which Remark argues, that
<i>Nitre</i> arises from a level Superficies or concretes in
a certain solitary Place. Moreover the porous <i>Nitre</i>
is dissolv’d in Water, but so that you cannot see
the least Settlement in it, altho’ a great deal of an
earthy Substance be found among it; and as a further
Argument of the Truth of this, its very Ashes
show it contains in it a great mixture of earthy Particles;
for burning once a Pound of crude <i>Nitre</i>, I
found four Ounces of Ashes remain’d, whereas our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span><i>Saltpetre</i>, if it but touch Fire, immediately flames,
and is in an instant resolv’d into Air; whence we
collect, that it consists of very subtil Parts, for ’tis
very pungent on the Tongue, has great Tenuity,
and plentifully provokes Spitle.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Three kinds of <i>Nitre</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There are three sorts
of <i>Nitre</i>, but that which is of a Rose-colour, or whitish
and porous like Sponge, such as is brought from
the Islands of <i>Buna</i>, <i>Dioscorides</i> prefers to the rest,
being hard and solid for the most part like that of
<i>Egypt</i>, and which indurates into heaps like Stone,
which therefore are call’d by the <i>Greeks</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Βουνοί</span>, from
the resemblance they have to Hills. The second sort
of <i>Nitre</i> is not so well distinguish’d by <i>Dioscorides</i> as
by <i>Galen</i>, who is thought to have us’d the name of
<i>Spuma Nitri</i> two ways, first by dividing the words,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀφρὸς νίτρου</span><a id='t260'></a>, and secondly, by compounding them into
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀφρόνιτρον</span>, which distinction <i>Pliny</i> also seems to
have observ’d where he calls the <i>Spuma Nitri</i> by the
<i>Latin</i> word <i>Operimentum</i>, interpreted by <i>Avicenna</i>’s
Annotator, <i>Capistrum Nitri</i>, not because the <i>Nitre</i>
ferments or foams up in an old Valley, or that it is
in it self a light Froth, but by reason the <i>Spume</i> of
<i>Nitre</i> lyes on the top of the <i>Nitre</i>, and flowers of it
self in Nitre-Works or Vallies in the Day-Time;
for <i>Nitre</i> flowers with the Dew which falls in the
Night, and then increases its Superficies and is perfected
in the Day-Time, which Covering therefore
is rightly call’d by <i>Avicenna</i>’s Interpreter <i>Capistrum</i>,
but better by <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Operimentum</i>. Of this <i>Dioscorides</i>
thus writes:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spuma Nitri.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘That <i>Spuma Nitri</i> is best which is
lightest, friable, biting and of a purplish Colour, such
as is brought from <i>Philadelphia</i> in <i>Lydia</i>. The second
sort is that of <i>Egypt</i>, which likewise is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>had in <i>Magnetia</i> in <i>Caria</i>.’ How this Efflorenscence
which <i>Pliny</i> sometimes calls <i>Operimentum</i>, sometimes
<i>Spuma Nitri</i>, and at other times <i>Aphronitrum</i>, is generated,
we have shewn before, so shall next show
what <i>Aphronitrum</i> is, for I distinguish between <i>Aphronitrum</i>
and <i>Spuma Nitri</i>, that is, the <i>Operimentum</i> or Covering.
But <i>Pliny</i> confounds <i>Aphronitrum</i> and <i>Nitrum</i>
together, so that I really believe both <i>Pliny</i> and
<i>Serapio</i> have taken what they have written of this
Matter from the same Fountains; for <i>Serapio</i> speaking
of <i>Nitre</i> says, There are two sorts of it, one
call’d <i>Nitre</i>, which is <i>Saltpetre</i>, of a reddish Colour,
saltish and bitterish Taste, soon discovering its burning
Quality,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Borax.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and another sort call’d <i>Borax</i>, us’d by
the Inhabitants of <i>Yaya</i> in working up their Bread,
to make it look clear after ’tis bak’d. But that sort
call’d artificial <i>Borax</i> is an incisive and abstersive
<i>Saltpetre</i>, made from a nitrous Matter, being a
mixture of Lead and <i>Kali</i> mingl’d together and put
over the Fire, and this seems to be nothing else but
that which the Goldsmiths use. <i>Rhasis</i> also is in a
manner of the same Opinion with <i>Serapio</i>, for he
says, of the two sorts of <i>Borax</i>, that which is made
artificially, and is white and froathy, is much better
than that of an earthy colour and dusty. It is from
this that <i>Tincar</i> is made and seal’d.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tincar.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Pliny</i> has not
omitted to mention this sealing as <i>Galen</i> and <i>Dioscorides</i>
have likewise done, therefore I will insert his
Words the better to show that his sealing of <i>Tincar</i>
is the same with that of the <i>Arabians</i>. The next
Age of <i>Physicians</i>, says he, deliver’d that <i>Aphronitrum</i>
was gather’d in <i>Asia</i>, distilling into soft Caves or
Dens, which they call’d <i>Colycæ</i>, and afterwards dry’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>in the Sun. The best sort is that of <i>Lydia</i>, which
is very light and friable, and almost of a purplish
Colour, and brought thence in little Cakes or Trochisks,
which words seem intirely to answer those
of the <i>Arabian</i>; for, What can this Author mean
by Trochisks, but the same thing which <i>Serapio</i> calls
little seal’d Pieces? But <i>Rhasis</i> adds, That the <i>Egyptian
Nitre</i> was brought in Vessels pitch’d over, least
it should melt; and <i>Pliny</i> shows, that the next Age
of Physicians deliver’d it was gather’d in <i>Asia</i>. Perhaps
in the Time of <i>Dioscorides</i>, and also before his
Time, they did not use to Seal the <i>Spuma Nitri</i> and
<i>Aphronitrum</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lydian Nitre.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Pliny</i> gives the Preference to the <i>Lydian</i>,
and, moreover, when he describes the Marks of
chusing it, he gives the same to the <i>Aphronitrum</i> as
<i>Dioscorides</i> does to his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀφρόνιτρον</span><a id='t262'></a>. But that I may
speak freely what I know of those three, they all
proceed from the same Mass, altho’ from the different
Places and Earth, they acquire a different colour,
for some are of a Rose-colour, and others white.
The <i>Operimentum</i> or Covering falls in <i>Lydia</i> and
<i>Egypt</i>. The greatest use of <i>Nitre</i> in <i>Laconia</i> is for
scouring Bodies. But since the Mass of <i>Nitre</i>, when
long kept in Houses, consumes and wastes away by
degrees, insomuch that that which was before hard,
becomes gradually soft and crumbling, more-especially
if it be kept in a moist place, nevertheless it does
not discontinue being a Mass or Lump, but only
becomes softer than <i>Nitre</i>. Physicians, when they
remark or take notice as it were of a certain kind of
<i>Metamorphosis</i>, of that which was before hard, so
easily to become softer, think its Name ought to be
chang’d, and its Virtues ascrib’d apart. But that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>which I have said concerning the alteration of <i>Nitre</i>,
I have found true by experience, in some I brought
with me out of the Eastern-Countries; for having
given a great part of it to my Friends, some of them
complain’d it was turn’d to Powder, and others, who
had kept it in a moister place, that it was grown
softer, and had chang’d its Colour. <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 31.
cap. 10. says, The Nature of <i>Nitre</i> is not to be
esteem’d very different from Salt, and this he the
more diligently asserts, inasmuch as those Physicians
who have written of it, were ignorant of its true
Nature, altho’ none has written more carefully of
it than <i>Theophrastus</i>. He says, moreover, some <i>Nitre</i>
is made in <i>Media</i>, the Vallies growing white and
hoary with dryness. After the Rain or Fountain-Water
is exhal’d from it, it is condens’d by the Soil,
and converted into <i>Nitre</i>. Hence appears, as I said
before, that those are very much deceiv’d, who report
<i>Nitre</i> to be a certain Subterranean Matter like
to Metal. <i>Pliny</i> afterwards adds, That the sort of
<i>Nitre</i> call’d <i>Agrium</i>, in <i>Thrace</i> near <i>Philippi</i>, is less
mix’d with Earth than any other sort; but I dare
affirm <i>Nitre</i> is now no longer made in <i>Thrace</i>, for
when I travell’d thither, and to and fro in the <i>Philippian</i>
Country, that I might see this <i>Nitre</i>, I could
find none either about the Ruins of the before-mention’d
City or the adjacent Region.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Chalastræum Nitrum.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The <i>Chalastræum
Nitre</i> took its Name from the City <i>Chalastra</i>. This I
believe to be that sort which <i>Alexander</i> call’d <i>Bucephalum</i>,
from the Name of his Horse. Nitrous Waters,
says <i>Pliny</i>, are found in many places, but without any
Power of condensing, which agrees with what I have
already said, that all nitrous Waters will not make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span><i>Nitre</i>; so likewise all nitrous Earth, altho’ Water
be pour’d over it, will not make <i>Nitre</i>, for ’tis necessary
it should have a Virtue of thickning by the
Sun, therefore this Virtue is believ’d not to be wanting
in the Water, but in the Earth, for ’tis certain <i>Nitre</i>
may be made out of the lightest, purest and sweetest
Water. <i>Nitre</i> is very heavy in it self, for it sinks in
Water like a Stone. The best <i>Nitre</i>, says <i>Pliny</i>, is
very plentiful in <i>Macedonia</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nitrum Chalastricum.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and is call’d <i>Chalastricum</i>,
being white and pure like to Salt. The Lake
is nitrous, and out of its middle a sweet Fountain
flows; there <i>Nitre</i> swims, about the rising of the
Dog-Star, for nine Days together, and in as many
ceases, then swims again, and afterwards ceases again,
by which ’tis apparent the heat of the Sun condenses
the <i>Nitre</i>, provided the Nature of the Soil be answerable,
as <i>Pliny</i> witnesses in these words: The Nature
of the Soil is what breeds <i>Nitre</i>, as is apparent,
in that where it is wanting, neither Salts nor Showers
avail any thing. This is also very wonderful, that
tho’ the Spring be always seen to flow, yet neither
does it increase the Lake nor run over; but if it
Rains in those Days in which it is bred, the <i>Nitre</i>
will become more Salt, and worse if the <i>North</i>-Winds
happen to blow, for they violently stir up
the Mud: In this place indeed ’tis produc’d, but
more plentifully in <i>Egypt</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Egyptian Nitre.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
tho’ a worser sort, for ’tis
of a dark colour and stony. It is made almost in
the same manner with Salt, only they let the Sea run
into their Salt-Pits, but the River <i>Nile</i> into their
<i>Nitre</i>-Works. The <i>Nile</i>-Water being drawn off
they dry it, and again infuse it in <i>Nitre</i>-Water 40
Days successively, but if it Rains they add less of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the River-Water. So soon as it begins to condense,
it is taken away least it should be dissolv’d in their
<i>Nitre</i>-Works, but if laid up in heaps it will keep.
Thus much <i>Pliny</i> speaks of <i>Nitre</i>, which abundantly
shows it is no where dug in any Mountain or Soil,
but as I have shown before, immediately so soon as
it has begun to condense, and it Rains, they take it
away, and lay it up in heaps, that it may last, for
otherwise it would be melted by the Rain in their
<i>Nitre</i>-Works. What <i>Pliny</i> says afterwards seems
obscure, <i>viz.</i> That the thinnest part of <i>Nitre</i> is best,
and consequently the Efflorenscence is better, nevertheless
the foul sort is useful for some Things, as for
dying Purples, Scarlets, <i>&amp;c.</i> by which words ’tis
evident he means two sorts of <i>Nitre</i>, one very fine
call’d <i>Spuma Nitri</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spuma Nitri.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which he prefers for the best,
and another course, us’d for dying Colours. The
<i>Nitre</i>-Works in <i>Egypt</i> are very famous, and were
wont to be only about <i>Naucratis</i> and <i>Memphis</i>:
The worst are about <i>Memphis</i>, for there it lapifies in
heaps, and from that cause many Hillocks are stony,
of which they make Vessels. They also very frequently
boil it with Sulphur upon Coals till it is
melted; and use it in those things they would have
keep a long while. There are <i>Nitre</i>-Works where it
comes out reddish from the colour of the Earth.
Thus far of <i>Nitre</i>; next <i>Pliny</i> mightily commends
the Efflorenscence of <i>Nitre</i>, yet says, The Ancients
deny’d it could be made, but only when the Dew
fell and the <i>Nitre</i>-Places were pregnant, but not
when they brought forth, therefore could not be
done by hastning or stirring up altho’ it fell. Others
think it was bred by Fermentation, <i>&amp;c.</i>’ Thus far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>of <i>Nitre</i> according to <i>Bellonius</i>, <i>Pliny</i> and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pickle</i> made of <i>Nitre</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>Now this is generally agreed on, that after the
Body was stuff’d with sweet Odours, Gums and Spices,
it was macerated in a sort of Pickle, the Composition
of which, tho’ unknown to us, is asserted by
most of the Ancients to be made of <i>Nitre</i>. Nor is it
proper for us, say <i>Penicher</i>, <cite>Traite des Embaumemens</cite>, p.
83. to explain one Obscurity by another that is greater;
since this <i>Nitre</i>, so famous and mightily boasted of by
the Ancients, is at this Day a Mistery, for the more
one endeavours to show its Origin, by examining the
different Descriptions given it, the more reason one
has to doubt of its Existence. In the first place, they
agree not in one point among themselves,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Different <i>Opinions</i> of <i>Nitre</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
either as
to its Colour, Figure or Quality; for some say ’tis
white, others that ’tis red, and others again that ’tis
of a Leaden or Ash-colour: Some there are who will
have it of a porous Substance like a Sponge, others that
’tis solid and compact, and others that ’tis shining and
transparent like to Glass. Nor do they less dissagree
about its Virtue than its Form and Colour, for some
say ’tis of a cold Nature, and others that it has a
Caustic Quality, as <cite>Herodotus</cite>, who says, that it consumes
the Flesh in such manner that it leaves nothing
but Skin and Bones. Wherefore, after so many Contradictions
and different Descriptions of the nature of
this Mineral, what can we believe for certain? Have
we not just reason to doubt that this <i>Nitre</i> is but pretended?
How should it come to be invisible if it were
a Mineral? And again why should we not have it, if
it be produc’d after the manner of our common Salt?
The Sun, Moon and other Planets, as also the Earth
have not ceas’d since their Creation to obey yearly such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Orders as the Divine Providence has prescrib’d them,
and their Productions have daily been the same from
one Age to another. The Earth is the same Matrix
for the formation of Vegetables and Minerals, and the
Sun has not refus’d its Influences for their Generation.
What therefore can be the reason, or by what accident
should we at present be depriv’d of so precious a
Salt? We cannot see why it should be so lost as never
to be repair’d; but it is also reported that the true
<i>Cinnamon</i>, <i>Bdellium</i>, <i>Costus Amomum</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balsamum verum</span></i>,
<i>Malobathrum</i>, <i>Sal Armoniac</i>, <i>Myrrha</i>, and several Minerals,
Gums and Plants are lost, yet certainly it is not
so, but only the Knowledge and Use of them lost to
many People; or perhaps they may not be found in
those places where they were wont to grow, yet may
be had in others, which often happens; so that they
do not entirely Perish, but only change their Soil, by
which means it may come to pass they may not commonly
be known, and sometimes it happens they appear
with a different Face, by reason of the diversity
of the Place and temperature of the Heavens; wherefore,
as St. <i>Chrisostom</i> rightly concludes, none of those
Substances or kinds of Things, which <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> has created
from the beginning of the World, have ever been
wanting or will ever perish. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et Benedixit illa <em class='gesperrt'>DEUS</em>,
&amp; dixit, Crescite &amp; multiplicamini: Verbum enim illud
in præsentem usq; diem illa conservat, &amp; tantum Tempus
præteriit, neq; unum horum Genus imminutum est; nam
Benedictio <em class='gesperrt'>DEI</em>, &amp; Verbum quod dixerat, ut subsisterent
&amp; durarent, illis contulit.</span></i> <i>And <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> Blessed them and
said, Be fruitful and multiply: Which Word has preserv’d
them even to this present Day, so that the Time only is pass’d
away, but not the least kind of them has perish’d; for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Blessing of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, and the Words which he spake, made
them that they should endure for ever.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Nitre</i> of the <i>Ancients</i> the same with our <i>Saltpetre</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Nitre</i> therefore of the Ancients so renown’d,
may be the same with our <i>Saltpetre</i>, as <i>Schroder</i> and
the learned <i>Etmuller</i> think, and <i>Clarke</i> more particularly
in his <i>Natural History</i> of <cite>Nitre</cite>, p. 12. asserts, That
the <i>Nitre</i> of the Ancients is the same with Ours: In
which, says he, altho’ we dissent from some learned
Philosophers, as <i>Matthiolus</i>, <i>Bellonius</i>, &amp;c. yet are there
others as learned with whom we agree, such as <i>Cardanus</i>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Casimirus Siemienowicz Eques Lithuanus</span></i>, and more particularly
also may be mention’d the Ingenious Mr. <i>Henshaw</i>,
who has learnedly prov’d this Assertion to the <i>Royal
Society</i>. But not to inforce this Opinion only by Authority
but Reason, we affirm this to be the same from
its Nature; for the Thing is yet in Being, and this bearing
its Name may not unjustly challenge its Nature:
And that this was known to the Ancients (as we affirm
their <i>Nitre</i> is to us) the Testimony of <i>Pliny</i> plainly
evinces, as the before-mention’d learned Author <i>Casimirus</i>
observes, <i>viz.</i> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aperte enim Salem hunc, qui in Cavernis
sua sponte in Rupium Superficies erumpebat, Florem
&amp; Spumam Nitri, Salemq; petrosum vel Petræ nominat</span></i>.
But the Ancients seem not to observe this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀφρόνιτρον</span> or
Efflorenscence of <i>Nitre</i> on Walls, and in Houses on
Floors, as we do, they having had it in open Fields, tho’
we have not, neither was it so much in use with them
as with us, and this gave occasion for the new Name
of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sal-petræ</span></i> to be given to the old <i>Nitre</i>. Now, tho’
by <i>Pliny</i>’s and other antient Authors descriptions of
<i>Nitre</i>, when compar’d with ours, they may seem to
differ, yet may it not be a real difference, but only in
degrees of purity, the like whereof we may see in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Sugar and Salt, which by artificial Refining are made
one and the same; and as it bears the same Name, so
has it the same Qualities and Virtues, and was antiently
us’d both by <i>Galenists</i> and <i>Chymists</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nitre</i> us’d in <i>Cookery</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now it was this
no doubt the Ancients us’d in their Aliments instead
of common Salt; and ’tis by some affirm’d that
Roots grow whiter if boil’d therewith, and Herbs
greener: Moreover, ’tis well known to us Moderns
that <i>Nitre</i> or its Salt, separated in the Refining, gives
a red colour to Neats-Tongues, Coller’d Beef, Bacon,
<i>&amp;c.</i> adding to it also a more savoury Taste, which
does thereby both invite and please the Appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus far of <i>Nitre</i> according to the several Opinions
of the before-mention’d Authors; but what the Composition
was, wherewith the Ancients pickl’d the Body,
whether with <i>Nitre</i> or Salt, is not as yet determin’d.
<cite>Herodotus</cite> and divers others affirm it was salted with
<i>Nitre</i>, yet some think the Virtue of Salt more commendable,
finding it of so great use in preserving
Flesh and Fish; others again do not think Bodies become
unperishable by Salting, but are only preserv’d
for some Months or Years, and if fresh Pickle be not
added, or any part of the Body happen to be expos’d
to the Air, it soon corrupts and stinks, for the Moisture
of the Air dissolves the imbib’d Salt, and this issuing
forth the Body soon perishes. This is farther remarkable
from a Story of <i>Baronius</i> in his Annals,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A <i>Body</i> found <i>Preserv’d</i> in a <i>Salt-Pit</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of a
Body found in a Subterranean Cave, full of salt Water,
in the Mountains of <i>Saltzburg</i>, which was whole and
incorrupt, the Skin white, the Eyes open and lively,
and the whole remaining, with all its parts, firm and
hard as a Stone, yet in three Days Time, being as it
were impatient of the Air, it turn’d into Water and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>perish’d. From this Story we may learn that salted
Bodies, altho’ they resist Corruption for a short Time,
yet at length perish;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Salt</i> us’d with <i>Balsamics</i> preserves <i>Bodies</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
nevertheless Salt, or such things
as are Analagous to it, if us’d with other Balsamics,
afford some help in the <i>Embalming</i> of Bodies, whereby
they are not dispos’d to the same Fluxion, as both
Reason and Experience teach, and perhaps <i>Nitre</i> being
a more solid Body and not so apt to dissolve in the Air,
might also on that account be preferr’d by the <i>Egyptians</i>.
However, whether <i>Salt</i> or <i>Nitre</i> be to be understood
by this Work of <i>Salination</i> needs not much to
be disputed, since both, by their known balsamic Virtue
and innate Siccity, may assist in this Operation,
even as in the preparing <i>English</i> Hams, <i>&amp;c.</i> we are
wont to use them mix’d together, the one perhaps being
more peircing and the other more durable, the
former to give a grateful Taste, and the latter a pleasant
Colour. But, as we cannot readily grant, that
the <i>Salting</i> us’d by the <i>Egyptians</i>, was effectual enough
to preserve Bodies without Balsamic Medicines, so neither
can we, that any means besides could hinder its
Extraction or Dissolution, and therefore I am the
more inclinable to think, <i>First</i>, That they did not drysalt
the Body, but macerated it in a liquid Pickle,
which equally surrounded it every-where, and peirc’d
deeper thro’ the Pores of the Skin; and when they
had let it infuse for a convenient Time, they anointed
it with Oil of <i>Cedar</i> for 30 Days together, as <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i> relates, and afterwards with <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Cinamon</i>
and other Drugs, which Salting and Anointing took
up in all 70 Days, according to the Account of <cite>Herodotus</cite>.
The latter Ointment was us’d as well to give
the Body a sweet Smell as to Preserve it; but, tho’ the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>former was held of great efficacy for that purpose, yet
is it a thing as difficult to recover in these our Times,
says <i>Penicher</i>, as it is to find out the Composition of
the Pickle we have been speaking of, nevertheless we
must make some attempt therein. First then, we will
take notice of the different Appellations, by which the
Ancients have us’d to express this Matter, calling it
by the several names of a Gum or Rosin, a Liquor or
Juice, an Oil or Ointment, and lastly a Pitch;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cedria</i> what.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but
which of all these they meant by the Word <i>Cedria</i> will
be better understood from a Description of that Tree,
together with the several sorts of Juices extracted from
it, and their Uses and Virtues. ’Tis true, as some Authors
have said, a Matter so call’d may be drawn
from other Trees, such as <i>Larch</i>, <i>Pine</i>, <i>Birch</i>, <i>Cypress</i>
and <i>Juniper</i>; but that which we mean is from the
great <i>Cedar</i>, whose Leaves never fall, and which bears
Fruit all the Year round. Its Wood, of all others, is
esteem’d the least corruptible, and consequently, says
<i>Pierius</i>, is the <i>Hieroglyphic</i> of Eternity. The Ark of
the Covenant, the Temple of <i>Solomon</i>, and that of
<i>Diana</i> at <i>Ephesus</i>, were all built with it, and for the
same reason the <i>Egyptians</i> often made their Coffins of
it: The Ancients also us’d to anoint the Leaves and
Covers of their Books with its Oil, thereby to defend
them from Moths, Worms and the injuries of Time,
whence it came to be spoken Proverbially of such a
one as had deserv’d to be recorded to Posterity, <i>Cedro
digna locutus</i>, in that his Writings were thereby preserv’d
from perishing. Now this Tree affords three or
four different sorts of Liquors or Juices: <i>First</i>, A thick,
but clear Gum, of a good tho’ strong Odour, being
a Tear that drops from young <i>Cedars</i> after their Barks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>are pill’d off, and this is what they properly call’d
<i>Cedria</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gum</i> of <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Secondly</i>, A sort of Liquor drawn from the
said Wood,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Liquor</i> of <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
call’d by the <i>Syrians</i> <i>Cedrum</i>, and which
are the first droppings of these Branches of <i>Cedar</i>
when one burns them, for that which comes last is
the <i>Pitch</i> of <i>Cedar</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pitch</i> of <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
being prepar’d after the same manner
with other Pitch, as you may find describ’d in
<cite>Bellonius de Medic. Funer.</cite> p. 40. <i>Lastly</i>, There is an
<i>Oil</i> of <i>Cedar</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Oil</i> of <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
express’d from the warm’d Fruit of this
Tree, and call’d by <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Delachampius</i>, <i>Cedrelæon</i>,
as it were <i>Cedri-oleum</i>. These several Liquors have
been so confounded by Authors, as to have been taken
indifferently for one another, which perhaps was because
they have almost all the same Virtues; yet I
suppose the <i>Egyptians</i> might adapt the Use of them
according to their several Consistencies, and therefore
employ’d the Gum with other Drugs in stuffing the
Body, the first distill’d Liquor in their Injections, and
the <i>Oil</i>, as more valuable, for their Anointings; or
else might use the <i>Tar</i> or <i>Pitch</i> after the same manner
as <i>Asphalt</i> and <i>Pissasphalt</i>, for the inferior sort of
People.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Virtues</i> of <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now in respect to the Virtues of <i>Cedar</i>, besides
that it heats and drys powerfully, it has likewise
this particular and remarkable Quality, that after the
nature of Septic and Escharotic Medicines, it corrodes
and consumes the Flesh in a very short Time, if apply’d
to a living Body; but, on the contrary, is a sovereign
Preservative for the same Body the very moment
’tis depriv’d of Life; for consisting of hot, dry
and subtil Parts, it consumes all superfluous Humidity,
the cause of Putrifaction, and thereby preserves the
dead Body, whereas in living Creatures, being rarify’d
and put in action by the natural Heat, it disunites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>their Parts and consumes them. Those antient Physicians
<i>Dioscorides</i>, <i>Galen</i>, <i>Paulus</i>, <i>Aetius</i> and <i>Aegineta</i>
have all asserted, That the Nature of <i>Cedar</i> was such
as to preserve dead Bodies, but would consume the
Living, whereupon, they not without reason have
term’d it, <i>The Life of the Dead</i>, and <i>The Death of the
Living</i>. Likewise <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> tells us, the <i>Egyptians</i>
anointed the Bodies they were to <i>Embalm</i> with
Oil or Ointment of <i>Cedar</i>, for the space of 30 Days;
whereas, <cite>Herodotus</cite> gives us a quite different Account,
how that, without cutting open the Belly and pulling
out the Entrails,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Clysters</i> of <i>Cedar</i> and their <i>Operation</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they injected up the <i>Anus</i> Clysters of
Oil or Juice of <i>Cedar</i>, and then salted the Body 70
Days, at the end of which they squeez’d out the Clysters,
which had such Virtue and Efficacy, that they
brought away with them all the Guts and Bowels
wasted. But in answer to this, <cite>Clauder in Methodo
Balsamandi</cite>, p. 58. says, he cannot but believe that this
Author had forgot to mention somewhat necessary to
be done besides, and <i>Nardius</i> laughs at it as a ridiculous
Story, to imagine how these Clysters should spare
the fleshy Parts, but rot the Bowels. But grant an intire
Efficacy to this Balsamic Liquor, thus Clysterwise
immitted into the Intestins, yet since it is well known
to Physicians, that Medicines, this way exhibited to
the Dead, immediately flow out again, the nervous
and fibrous Parts, which before were us’d to retain
them, operate no longer by reason of their Stupor
and defect of Spirits. I cannot see, says <i>Clauder</i>, how
a Clyster can be contain’d in a dead body so as to
perform its Work, or if it should be intruded up by
force, it cannot so quickly penetrate to the superior
Parts; for it must waste the <i>Mesentery</i>, <i>Liver</i>, <i>Spleen</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span><i>Stomach</i> and <i>Guts</i> before it can ascend into the Cavity
of the Breast, by which time its Contents will be putrify’d,
and that more-especially since nothing besides
was done to prevent Corruption, but an external <i>Salting</i>.
Wherefore, as was said before, he must needs
have mistaken the Process, and perhaps if Bodies were
<i>Embalm’d</i> this way with <i>Cedar</i> (which <i>Nardius</i> utterly
denies) without Incision and Exenteration, it might be
perform’d by filling the Head, Breast and Belly with
Pitch of <i>Cedar</i> (the way of doing which I shall hereafter
show) and then infusing and macerating the Body
in its liquid Juice or Oil: And that the <i>Egyptians</i> us’d
to <i>Embalm</i> Bodies with <i>Cedar</i>, appears farther from
their preserving <i>Crocodiles</i>, <i>Hawks</i> and other Animals,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Animals Embalm’d</i> with <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which they worshipp’d, with <i>Nitre</i> and the Liquor of <i>Cedar</i>,
and afterwards anointing them with odoriferous
Unguents, they bury’d them in Sacred Places: <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i>, Lib. 5. cap. 2. says, the <i>Gauls</i> were wont to
deposite the Heads of their slain Enemies, that were
of any Quality, in Chests, having first <i>Embalm’d</i> them
with Oil of <i>Cedar</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third sort of <i>Embalming</i>, us’d for the poorer
sort of People, was perform’d, as <cite>Herodotus</cite> tells us,
by washing the Belly, and then drying it with Salt for
70 Days, after which ’twas deliver’d to be carry’d
away. Now, as <i>Clauder</i> says, if this was done without
Exenteration, it appears the least probable of all,
as daily experience shows; therefore we must look on
that Historian as too credulous in the Relation of some
Things, and perhaps as one that had forgot other
Operations to be done, or medicinal Species to be added:
But if the Belly was open’d and thoroughly
wash’d and cleans’d, the Bowels flung into the River
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>or else bury’d, and the Vessels empty’d of their Blood
and Juices, and then the Body salted and dry’d in the
Sun, it might probably be render’d very hard and durable,
and not liable to dissolve or melt by any Damps
or Moisture, <i>Egypt</i> being a warm Country, and enjoying
a perpetual Serenity of Air, even as Flesh and
Fish when salted and dry’d in the Wind, Sun or Smoak,
<i>&amp;c.</i> may be preserv’d for some Years, if kept in a dry
and warm place. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> speaks nothing of
this third sort of <i>Embalming</i>, and <i>Gabriel Clauder</i>, <i>Johannes
Nardius</i>, <i>Bellonius</i>, and other Physicians assert,
there were only two sorts,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Only two sorts of <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
one for the Rich and Noble,
perform’d after a more accurate and costly manner,
and another more vile for the poorer Sort; for <i>Nardius</i>
is of Opinion, that which was suppos’d to be perform’d
with <i>Cedar</i>, was only a cheat of the <i>Libitinarii</i>
to pick the Pockets of the richer People; the first
sort being perform’d with odoriferous Gums and Spices,
and the latter with a strong scented Bitumen call’d
<i>Asphalt</i>, or for want of that with <i>Pissasphalt</i>, which
things are not mention’d in the Accounts of <cite>Herodotus</cite>
and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> relating to <i>Embalming</i>; yet from
the occular Demonstration of several eminent Physicians,
and their Experiments and Dissections of such
Bodies as are commonly brought over for <i>Mummies</i>,
it is plainly prov’d they were prepar’d with this Bituminous
Matter, therefore we will next describe what
that is. Now seeing Authors so much confound <i>Asphalt</i>
with <i>Pissasphalt</i>, and thereby become mistaken
even in the word <i>Mummy</i>, I think it very necessary to
show their differences, they being two sorts of <i>Bitumen</i>
that were commonly us’d by the <i>Egyptians</i> in
their <i>Embalmings</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Asphalt.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>First then of <i>Asphalt</i>, a natural <i>Bitumen</i> of a viscous
and glutinous Substance, which swims on the surface
of the Lake <i>Asphaltites</i> in <i>Palestine</i> (above 100 Miles
from <i>Damiata</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, whereas <i>Le Bruyn</i> is grosly
mistaken when he makes it but two <i>Italian</i> Miles, as
before quoted, <i>p.</i> 143.) and being driven by the Winds
on the Shoar, there condenses by the heat of the Sun,
and becomes tough and hard like Pitch. There is also
<i>Bitumen</i> found in several other places, as <i>Dioscorides</i>
relates, <i>viz.</i> in <i>Phœnicia</i>, <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Sydon</i>, &amp;c. But this
which comes from the Lake <i>Asphaltites</i> in <i>Judea</i>,
thence call’d <i>Bitumen Judaicum</i>, is the best of all, being
clean and shining, of a black or purplish Colour,
of a strong Smell, and that may easily be burn’d and
crumbl’d between the Fingers. With this <i>Asphalt</i>
were <i>Embalm’d</i> those of a middle sort,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How us’d in <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but by reason
it was of too dry a Substance, <i>Naptha</i> and liquid <i>Bitumen</i>,
or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oleum Petroleum</span></i> were usually added to it by
melting over the Fire, and then the Body being boil’d
therein, the <i>Embalming</i> was finish’d according to the
accustom’d manner: To this purpose Authors give
these Reasons for the use of <i>Asphalt</i>, that by its astringent
and exsiccating Nature, it restrains that moisture
which would lead to Corruption, and no less by its
balsamic Quality and Viscosity hinders the fluid Atoms
of the Air from penetrating the internal parts of the
Body, thereby opening a way for its Dissolution. In
like manner the poorer Sort were <i>Embalm’d</i> with <i>Pissasphalt</i>,
made fluid by some of the above-mention’d
Oils; and seeing likewise there were said to be two
kinds of this, one Natural and another Artificial, we
will next enquire into them:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Natural <i>Pissasphalt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The Natural <i>Pissasphalt</i>, according to <i>Dioscorides</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span><i>Valerius Cordus</i> his Commentator, and others, is a kind
of <i>Bitumen</i> flowing from certain Mountains call’d <i>Ceraunii
Montes</i> in <i>Apollonia</i>, near the City <i>Epidaurus</i>,
now <i>Ragusa</i>, whence being carry’d by the impetuosity
of the River, it is cast on the Shoar and there condens’d
into Clods, smelling like to a mixture of <i>Pitch</i>
and <i>Bitumen</i>, from whence it came to be term’d by
the <i>Greeks</i> <i>Pissasphaltos, a</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πίσσα</span>, <i>vel</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πίττα</span> <i>pix, &amp;</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄσφαλτος</span>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bitumen, quasi dicas Pici Bitumen</span></i>, and had the same
Virtues with <i>Pitch</i> and <i>Bitumen</i> or <i>Asphalt</i> mix’d together.
’Tis brought in great Plenty from <i>Valona</i> to
<i>Venice</i> for pitching Ships, which it admirably performs
if mix’d with the Pitch of <i>Pine-Trees</i>. ’Tis also brought
from <i>Dalmatia</i>, being there dug near <i>Lesina</i>, not far from
<i>Narenta</i>, and is likewise found in <i>Hungary</i>, where the
Inhabitants call it <i>Fossil</i> Wax; moreover ’tis to be had
in <i>Transilvania</i>, and the Germans name it <b>Erdtwachs</b>
and <b>Bergwachs</b>, that is Wax generated in the Earth
or Mountains. The <i>Spaniards</i> likewise call it, <i>Cera de
minera</i>, mineral Wax, perhaps from its Consistency;
but the <i>Arabians</i> term it <i>Mumia</i>, whence, it may be,
<i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies came to be call’d <i>Mummies</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Call’d <i>Mummy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from
their being preserv’d with this <i>Pissasphalt</i>, and this we
are the more apt to believe, since the true <i>Asphalt</i> or
<i>Bitumen Judaicum</i> was very scarce, nor is it now to
be had in the Shops, as some believe, but <i>Pissasphalt</i>
is sold in its stead. <i>Brasavolus</i> thinks those dry’d Bodies
of the <i>Arabians</i> and other Nations, brought to us from
<i>Syria</i> and <i>Egypt</i> for <i>Mummies</i>, were only fill’d with
<i>Pissasphalt</i>, inasmuch as being the poorer sort of People
in those Countries, they could not be suppos’d to afford
the expence of a better <i>Embalment</i>, for the Rich and
Noble, whose Bodies were <i>Embalm’d</i> more costly with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span><i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i>, <i>Cinamon</i>, <i>Balsam</i>, <i>Saffron</i>, and the like, were
so carefully inclos’d in their private Sepulchres, that it
was not only a very difficult matter to get at them,
but also more rare to bring any of them over; whereas
the Bodies of the Poor and Ignoble, stuff’d only
with <i>Pissasphalt</i>, of so mean a price and after so slight
a manner, were to be come at with little trouble and
less suspicion. Thus the <i>Syrians</i> and <i>Egyptians</i> were
wont to condite their Bodies, and the <i>Arabians</i> also,
from what <i>Matthiolus</i> could learn from their Writings,
esteem’d <i>Mummy</i> to be <i>Pissasphalt</i> rather than <i>Asphalt</i>,
for, as <i>Avicenna</i> writes, <i>Mummy</i> performs the very
same thing as <i>Asphalt</i> does, when mix’d with <i>Pitch</i>;
from whence we may easily conjecture, that the Bodies
were only prepar’d with <i>Pissasphalt</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bodies</i> only prepar’d with <i>Pissasphalt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With this
also <i>Serapio</i> agrees, who, discoursing of <i>Mummy</i>, according
to the Authority of <i>Dioscorides</i>, delivers the
very same words as he does of <i>Pissasphalt</i>, affirming,
there is <i>Mummy</i> or <i>Pissasphalt</i> in the Land of <i>Apollonia</i>,
which, descending from the Mountains by the course
of the River, is cast upon its Banks, and there coagulated
like Wax, having the Smell of <i>Pitch</i> mix’d with
<i>Asphalt</i>, with some <i>Fætor</i>, and its Virtue is like to <i>Pitch</i>
and <i>Asphalt</i> mix’d together, whence ’tis also thought
our <i>Mummy</i> is rather <i>Pissasphalt</i> than <i>Asphalt</i>; for
altho’ <i>Strabo</i> says, The <i>Bitumen Judaicum</i> was us’d for
preserving Bodies, nevertheless he does not deny but
they mix’d <i>Pitch</i> with <i>Bitumen</i>, which makes an artificial
<i>Pissasphalt</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Artificial <i>Pissasphalt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but <i>Serapio</i> and <i>Avicenna</i> knew these
Mixtures very well, since not only the <i>Syrians</i>, but,
their Countrymen the <i>Mauritanians</i> also made use of it.
Also that which is sold to us for <i>Mummy</i>, is only the
Body of an <i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Arabian</i>, or the like, <i>Embalm’d</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>with <i>Pissasphalt</i>, neither is it always properly so, says
<i>Struppius</i>, for they sometimes us’d to lay the Bones of
a Human Body in their proper places, and pour’d over
them melted <i>Pissasphalt</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sophisticate <i>Mummy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which working into the natural
form and shape of the Body, they sent over for
<i>Mummy</i>, and such is that which is brought to us even
at this Day, having no particle of <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i>, <i>Balsam</i>,
&amp;c. mix’d with it, as manifestly appears from its
Smell, Taste and Colour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus having shew’d how the <i>Egyptians</i> preserv’d
their Dead after several ways, as by <i>Salination</i> with
<i>Aromatics</i>, <i>Salination</i> with <i>Cedar</i>, <i>Asphalt</i> or <i>Pissasphalt</i>,
and by <i>Salination</i> with <i>Salt</i> alone, according to the Accounts
of <cite>Herodotus</cite>, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> and the Observations
of other Persons upon them, I will next add
some other Remarks concerning the Nature of their
<i>Embalmings</i>, and the respective Works of the several
Persons employ’d therein; likewise, the manner of
Rouling, Painting and Dressing their Dead, with the
Ceremonies of Judging them, ferrying them over
the Lake, keeping them in their Houses, setting them
at their Tables, pawning them, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>First then, we will suppose the <i>Egyptians</i> had a certain
Temple or Office wherein all Things were kept
in order for <i>Embalming</i> a Body,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>An <i>Office</i> of <i>Embalming</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to which there belong’d,
and where there resided all sorts of Persons
who perform’d any particular part of that <i>Art</i>, as
Washing, Salting, Anointing, <i>&amp;c.</i> or else prepar’d any
kind of Necessaries for the Funeral Pomp. Now these
were distinguish’d by the several Names of a <i>Priest</i> or
<i>Physician</i>, an <i>Embalmer</i> or <i>Surgeon</i>, a <i>Pollinctor</i> or <i>Apothecary</i>,
a <i>Dissector</i> or <i>Anatomist</i>, a <i>Salinator</i> or <i>Salter</i>
and a <i>Designer</i> or <i>Painter</i>, also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Νεκροκόσμος</span>, a <i>Dresser</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>of the Dead, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνταφιαστής</span>, one that furnish’d all Necessaries
for the Funeral, and bury’d the Body, being
call’d in <i>Latin</i> <i>Libitinarius</i>: That there was such an
Office, appears not only from these several Persons,
mention’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, who
were employ’d therein, and either profess’d the <i>Art of
Embalming</i>, or perform’d some other part belonging
to the Funeral Pomp, but is also prov’d from their
saying, <i>That the dead Body was carry’d out to be Embalm’d</i>,
which plainly implies some certain place allotted
for that purpose. First therefore, we will suppose
there belong’d to this Office a Clerk,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Clerk</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who shew’d, the
Friends of the Deceas’d, Patterns of all sorts of things
belonging either to the <i>Libitinarii</i> or Furnishers of the
<i>Funeral</i>, or to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curatores Corporis</span></i>, the <i>Embalmers</i>,
who having agreed with them after what manner, and
at what Price they would have it done, enter’d it into
a Book, and took care to see it perform’d accordingly.
The President or Head of this College, we take
to be one who was both a <i>Priest</i> and <i>Physician</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Physician</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and
therefore was highly Honour’d, and had in the greatest
Esteem and Respect. As a <i>Priest</i> he was qualify’d to
instruct the several Officers in all Funeral Rites and
Ceremonies, and confirm the People in the <i>Metempsychosis</i>,
upon which those Matters were grounded: As
a <i>Physician</i>, being skill’d in the <i>Art of Embalming</i>, and
the Nature of all Vegetables and Minerals, he prescrib’d
balsamic Medicines and odoriferous Unguents
for the <i>Apothecary</i> to compound and apply pursuant
to his Directions, and instructed the <i>Surgeon</i> how to
perform the manual Operation. That there was a
<i>Physician</i> made use of in <i>Embalming</i>, appears very plainly
from the Second Verse of the 50th Chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>where <i>Moses</i>, speaking of the Death of <i>Jacob</i>,
says his Son <i>Joseph commanded his Servants, the Physicians,
to Embalm his Father, and the Physicians Embalm’d
Israel</i>; where by <i>his Servants, the Physicians</i>, seems to
be meant either those properly belonging to his Person,
it being antiently a Custom for Princes and Noble
Men to have such in their Families to wait upon and
take care of them, or by the Repetition <i>The Physicians
Embalm’d</i> Israel, might be meant those of the <i>Office</i>,
since <i>Joseph</i>, being Viceroy of <i>Egypt</i>, might well command
them, they being all his Servants and in subjection
to him.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i> of <i>Jacob</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This leads me to digress a little in
order to give a further Account of the <i>Embalming
Jacob</i>, whereby will appear how far those Heathen
Writers before-mention’d agree with the <i>Scripture</i>.
First then there was a great necessity for <i>Embalming
Jacob</i>, by reason his Body was to be carry’d a great
way to his Sepulchre, and both <cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i> tell us, there were those in <i>Egypt</i> that profess’d
the Art of preserving Bodies from Corruption,
which ’tis plain was part of the Physicians Emploiment,
for the word <i>Ropheim</i> (which we Translate <i>Physicians</i>)
constantly signifies in Scripture such as cur’d or heal’d
sick Bodies; but the LXX. here aptly enough Translate
it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνταφιαστὰς</span>, (those that prepar’d and fitted Bodies for
their Interment by <i>Embalming</i> as we, says the Bishop
of <i>Ely</i>, likewise Translate it) because that was their
proper Business; whence ’tis <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 11. chap. 37.
says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos est Ægyptiis Cadavera asservare Medicata</span></i>, <i>’Tis
the Custom among the</i> Egyptians <i>to preserve dead Bodies
by the Physicians Art</i>. In this Art they excell’d all the
World besides, Bodies of their <i>Embalming</i> remaining
entire even to this Day, and no question but <i>Joseph</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>who spar’d neither Cost nor Pains, had his Father <i>Embalm’d</i>
after the noblest manner.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Perform’d in <i>Forty Days</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>And Forty Days were
fulfill’d for him (for so are fulfill’d the Days of those that
are Embalm’d) and the Egyptians Mourn’d for him Threescore
and Ten Days</i>, ver. 3. That is, Forty Days were
spent in <i>Embalming</i> him, which could not be finish’d
in a shorter Time, for <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> tells us of several
Officers that were employ’d about it one after
another, and that they anointed the dead Body with
<i>Balsam</i> of <i>Cedar</i> for above 30 Days, and afterwards
with <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Cinamon</i>, and the like, which might make
up the residue of 40 Days: But <cite>Herodotus</cite> differs from
him in this, by adding 30 Days more for Salting the
Body with <i>Nitre</i>, which makes in all 70 Days, the full
Time of their Mourning,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Time</i> of their <i>Mourning</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they being accustom’d to
spend all that Time, which they were <i>Embalming</i> the
Body and preparing for the Funeral, in Mourning, the
manner of which we have before describ’d, <i>p.</i> 241,
243, 245, 247. so shall here only farther take notice
what some object, that this Mourning was immoderate,
having more of Ambition than Piety in it; to
which <i>Jacobus Capellus</i> answers, That granting it be
true, that <i>Joseph</i> did not bring in this Custom, and
had peculiar Reason to follow what he found in use,
that they might be more condemn’d who vex’d the
innocent Posterity, on whose Parent they had bestow’d
Royal Honours; there is besides something due to
Kings and great Men to distinguish them from common
People. <i>Now when the Days of Mourning were past</i>,
that is 70 Days, <i>Joseph went up to Bury his Father, and
with him went up all the Servants of Pharaoh, the Elders
of his House, and all the Elders of the Land of Egypt</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Funeral Procession.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
ver. 7. The principal Persons in Authority and Dignity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>throughout the whole Country, as well such as
were Governors of Provinces and Cities, Counsellors,
<i>&amp;c.</i> as such as were principal Officers at Court. <i>And
all the House of Joseph, and his Brethren, and his Fathers
House</i>, ver. 8. <i>And there went up with him both
Chariots and Horsemen</i>, v. 9. as a Guard to him, which
’tis likely always attended him, as Viceroy of the Kingdom,
but now might be necessary for his safety as he
pass’d thro’ the Desarts. <i>And it was a very great Company.</i>
That he might appear in great State at such a Solemnity.
<i>When they came beyond Jordan they mourn’d with
a great and very sore Lamentation seven Days</i>, the Time
of public Mourning among the <i>Jews</i> in succeeding
Ages, as appears from several Instances, particularly,
1 <i>Sam.</i> 31. 13. <i>Eccl.</i> 22. 13. <i>Judith</i> 16. 20. Moreover
this shows the Lamentation was so exceeding
great, that the Place where it was made was afterwards
call’d <i>Abel-Mizraim</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Abel-Mizraim.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that is, <i>The Mourning of the</i> Egyptians.
But how they bury’d <i>Jacob</i> when they came
into <i>Canaan</i>, as also concerning the nature of the Cave
wherein they laid him, see the Bishop of <i>Ely</i>’s Notes
on the 50th Chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite>, from whom I have
chiefly extracted this; and other Commentators, for
I think it high time to return to the <i>Embalming</i> of the
<i>Egyptians</i>, according to the propos’d institution of an
Office, in which having already shown the respective
Emploiments of the <i>Clerk</i> and <i>Priest</i> or <i>Physician</i>, we
shall next proceed to speak of the <i>Surgeon</i> or <i>Embalmer</i>,
and of all other inferior Officers under him, such as
the <i>Dissector</i>, <i>Emboweller</i>, <i>Pollinctor</i>, <i>Salter</i>, and other
dependant Servants, as <i>Dressers of the Dead</i>, <i>Painters</i>,
<i>Carvers</i>, and the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Surgeon</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Surgeon</i>, who was the chief <i>Embalmer</i>, generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>directed and took care to see the several Operations
perform’d in due order, and sometimes did them
himself; for tho’ the <i>Curatores Corporis</i>, that were his
Assistants and Servants, commonly Dissected, Embowell’d,
Wash’d, Anointed and <i>Embalm’d</i> the Bodies of the
meaner sort of People, yet when any Prince or Nobleman
was to be <i>Embalm’d</i>, after the richest and most
curious manner, he perform’d the chief part of the
Work himself, and this he was the more capable of
as being both an exquisite <i>Anatomist</i>, and well vers’d
in the Nature of all <i>Balsamic</i> Medicines, whether
<i>Galenical</i> or <i>Chymical</i>, and tho’ he might be something
inferior to the <i>Physician</i>, yet in conjunction with
him, was he both the better able to consider the Nature
of the deceas’d Person’s Distemper, or Cause of
his Death, and accordingly to proceed in his <i>Embalming</i>;
and lastly, he was very dextrous and knowing in
the <i>Art</i> of <i>Bandage</i>, whereby it appears his chief Business
was to <i>Embalm</i> and Roul up the Body, which, in
respect to its being thus preserv’d by Balsamic and
Medicinal Ingredients, artificially and topically apply’d,
was said to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Medicatum</span></i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Medicatum.</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a Body preserv’d from
Putrifaction by <i>Embalming</i>. Now I cannot imagine, as
some Authors affirm, they did this always in one road
or manner, but that the Physician vary’d his Prescriptions,
by adding one thing and subtracting another,
increasing the quantity of one Ingredient or diminishing
that of another, according to the Constitution of the
Person, and Nature of his Disease, agreeable to which
was the <i>Embalming</i> perform’d; for ’tis certain some
Medicines are more prevalent against Putrifactions
than others, and that there ought to be a difference,
as well, in the Composition of the Medicine, as in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span><i>Embalming</i> one that dy’d only thro’ a natural Decay,
one that dy’d of some malignant Distemper, or one
that dy’d of a <i>Hectic</i> Feaver, which consumes and
dries up the radical Moisture of the Body, and one
that dy’d of a <i>Dropsie</i>, which colliquates the Body and
makes it fluid with its Waters. In a word, there ought
to be a difference even in an old Body and a Young;
therefore, as the Doctor’s Prescriptions were vary’d, according
to these Considerations, so was there a greater
occasion for a skilful Apothecary, to take care of and
see to the compounding the <i>Aromatic Powders</i>, <i>Oils</i>,
<i>Balsams</i>, <i>Ointments</i>, <i>Cerecloths</i>, <i>Tinctures</i>, <i>Spirits</i>, and
the like analogous Things, and their Application, according
to the Directions of the <i>Doctor</i>; and as the <i>Surgeon</i>
had under him a <i>Dissector</i>, &amp;c.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dissector.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who embowell’d
and wash’d the Body, and did the like inferior Businesses,
so had the <i>Apothecary</i> Servants under him to make
up the Medicines, administer Clysters and Injections,
and to Anoint the Body, thence call’d <i>Pollinctors</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pollinctor.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus was the chief Concern of the <i>Embalming</i> a Body
manag’d by the Advice and Assistance of the <i>Physician</i>,
<i>Surgeon</i> and <i>Apothecary</i>, as indeed it ought also to be
perform’d at this Day, and not to have ignorant <i>Undertakers</i>
direct and act all things at their pleasure.
But when Bodies were to be <i>Embalm’d</i> without <i>Gums</i>,
<i>Spices</i>, <i>Cedria</i>, <i>Asphalt</i>, <i>Pissasphalt</i> or the like, such as
the poorest People, who could not be at the expence
of them, they were chiefly committed to the Care of
the <i>Taricheutæ</i> or <i>Salitores</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Taricheutæ Salitores.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who only prepar’d and
dry’d them with <i>Salt</i>, and then such Bodies were
call’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpora Condita</span></i>, pickl’d or salted Bodies.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpora Condita.</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus having
shown the principal Persons of this <i>Office</i>, and who
directed and perform’d the <i>Embalming</i>, we will next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>give an account of those that provided all things necessary
for the Funeral. These were such as the <i>Greeks</i>
call’d <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνταφιαστής</span>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνταφιαστής</span>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
he that got the Body ready and prepar’d
all Necessaries for the Interment;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνταφιοπώλις</span>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνταφιοπώλις</span>, he
that sold all Matters appertaining to Funerals, and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Νεκροκόσμος</span> the Dresser,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Νεκροκόσμος</span>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or one that put on the Ornaments
of the Dead: But all these were term’d by the
<i>Romans</i> in general <i>Libitinarii</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Libitinarii.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the <i>Undertakers</i> and <i>Furnishers</i>
of Funerals, who had the Care of preparing, letting
out or selling the Ornaments and Dresses for the
Dead, and of providing Mourners, mourning Habits,
and whatever else was necessary for the Funeral Pomp;
nay who eas’d the afflicted Friends of their Trouble.
They were thus nam’d from <i>Libitina</i>, a Goddess whom
the Ancients believ’d to preside over Funerals, and
some took to be <i>Proserpina</i>, but others <i>Venus</i>, thereby
to show, that as she was at the beginning of Life by
Generation, so was she likewise at the end or conclusion
thereof, inasmuch as in her Temple were kept and
sold all things necessary for Funeral-Solemnities. Other
<i>Officers</i> were the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Painter</i>, <i>Carver</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Herald</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Herald’s</i> Business was to proclaim and give notice
of the approaching Funeral, to summon and invite
the Company, and lastly to marshall them in the
Funeral-Procession, according to their respective Dignities
and Quality.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Painter.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The <i>Painter</i> was to gild or paint
the Body and Coffin, with <i>Hieroglyphic</i> Characters,
<i>&amp;c.</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Carver.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And the <i>Carver</i> to make the Models of Wood that
were to be shown to the deceas’d Person’s Friends, to denote
that they <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies three several Ways, and
at as many different Rates; they likewise wrought the
Coffins into the shape and form of the Deceas’d. But
we shall speak more of these in their order, after having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>first given some Particulars relating to the several Methods
of the <i>Egyptian Embalming</i>, not hitherto so fully
describ’d.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i> with <i>Cedar</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
First then, we believe the manner of <i>Embalming</i>
with <i>Cedar</i> might probably be invented to
satisfie such whose Consciences would admit of no
Dissection at all, and the most likely Method of performing
it was by injecting into the <i>Brain</i>, thro’ the
<i>Nostrils</i>, into the <i>Thorax</i>, thro’ the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspera Arteria</span></i>, and
into the <i>Stomach</i> and <i>Intestines</i>, thro’ the <i>Oesophagus</i>
and <i>Anus</i>, <i>Oil</i> of <i>Cedar</i>, by the help of a <i>Siringe</i> and
<i>Dilator</i>. This being a subtil, hot, and rectify’d Oil of
a <i>Caustic</i> Nature, wasted and consum’d the Bowels like
to quick Lime, and then the Body being hung up or
plac’d in a declining posture, they press’d and squeez’d
out the said Oil, which brought away with it the
Bowels wasted. Then the Corps being wash’d and
cleans’d, they again injected into all the <i>Cavities</i> and
<i>Venters</i>, as much as they could of a <i>Balsam</i> distill’d
from the Pitch of young <i>Cedars</i>, which being depriv’d
of its corrosive and subtil Oil, had nothing of
a <i>Caustic</i> Quality remaining in it, but consisted only
of drying, exsiccating and <i>Balsamic</i> Parts. Then they
laid the Body in Pickle for 70 Days; after which,
having wip’d it, they anointed it with a sweet and
drying Ointment, which perhaps from the <i>Basis</i> of
its Composition might be term’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum Cedrinum</span></i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum Cedrinum.</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and then dry’d it in the Sun or otherwise, by which
means all remaining Moisture, and the thinner and
more subtil parts of the <i>Balsam</i> being evaporated, the
Body became hard, firm and solid, like to a <i>Colophony</i>
of Turpentine or Pitch.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Embalming</i> with <i>Pissasphalt</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The second Way of <i>Embalming</i> among the <i>Egyptians</i>
was perform’d with natural or factitious <i>Pissasphalt</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>just in the same manner as I shall show with <i>Asphalt</i>,
but only the natural <i>Pissasphalt</i> was us’d for the midling
sort of People, and the factitious for the poorer
and common People and Slaves; nor was there any
Curiosity in these more than the usual Exenteration,
Salination and Coction in the <i>Bitumens</i>, for they neither
us’d Roulers nor bestow’d Coffins on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third sort, which was for the more substantial
People,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Embalming</i>
with <i>Asphalt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was more costly and exact, and perform’d
with <i>Asphalt</i> after this manner: The Corps being
open’d, embowell’d, wash’d, cleans’d and salted after
the usual Method, was put into a large Cauldron fill’d
with <i>Asphalt</i>, or <i>Bitumen Judaicum</i>, made fluid with
<i>Naptha</i>, and then boil’d ’till it had melted the Fat, and
consum’d all the Humors and Juices which are the
Principals of Corruption, by which means the soft
parts of the Flesh were made firm, and the whole
Body penetrated, and as it were pitch’d to the Marrow
of the Bones, with this Bituminous Liquor. Then
being taken out of the Cauldron, and swath’d up whilst
it was yet hot, it at length became petrify’d and hard
like to Marble.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Embalming</i> with <i>Aromatics</i> and <i>Balsams</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The fourth and last way is both Noble and Expensive,
and was perform’d to the utmost Perfection, Art
and Skill. The <i>Brain</i> being extracted, and the <i>Thorax</i>
and <i>Abdomen</i> releas’d of their <i>Viscera</i>, all the Cavities
were thoroughly cleans’d with aromatiz’d Wine, and
then repleted with a Composition of <i>Myrrh</i>, <i>Aloes</i>, <i>Cinamon</i>,
<i>Opobalsamum</i>, <i>Saffron</i>, and the like; after which,
they sew’d up the Incisions, and salted the Body with
<i>Nitre</i> for 70 Days, and then wiping and drying it
from the Pickle or Salt, they anointed it with an Ointment
made of aromatic, balsamic and odoriferous Ingredients,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>whence some Authors have call’d a Body
so prepar’d, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Funus odoratum</span></i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Funus odoratum.</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This done, they swath’d
it up with Roulers made of fine Linnen, and dipp’d in
some <i>Balsam</i>, <i>Ointment</i> or <i>Cerecloth</i>, which being dry,
serv’d like Glue to stop the Pores, and hinder the Dissipation
of the volatil parts of the Aromatics, as well
as the Penetration of the Air. <cite>Guichard</cite>, cap. 10. p. 479.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Funerailles des Ægyptiens</span></i>, thinks this Gum to have
been <i>Acacia</i>, of which see <i>Dioscorides</i>, Lib. 1. cap. 134.
<cite>&amp; apud Mathiol.</cite> p. 115. But <i>Bellonius</i> and other Authors
think the Gum which <cite>Herodotus</cite> says the <i>Egyptians</i>
us’d instead of Glue was <i>Cedria</i>, besmear’d on the
Roulers in manner of a Cerecloth:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Roulers</i> how prepar’d, <i>&amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Others say the
Body was first anointed with a Gum, and then wrapped
up in fine Linnen, and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Casalius de veter. Ægyptior.
Ritibus</span></cite>, p. 30. says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gummi Oleo inungebant</span></i>, which is
more agreeable to the Observations I have made, That
the Roulers seem’d either dipp’d <i>in Oleo seu Unguento
Cedrino</i>, or after the Body was anointed with it, roul’d
up and finish’d, then that the Bandages were prepar’d
after the manner of a Cerecloth, with <i>Gum</i> or <i>Rosin</i>
of <i>Cedar</i>, because this would have made them hard
and brittle, whereas those which I have seen, were
pliable and free from any <i>Gum</i> or <i>Embalming</i> Matter
adhering to them, and no ways different from other
Linnen, but only of a Cinnamon or Snuff-Colour;
so that probably they might dip or anoint them with
the Oil or Ointment of <i>Cedar</i>, rather to make them
lasting and durable than to stick to the Body; for
<i>Greaves</i> tells us in his <cite>Pyramidographia</cite>, p. 50. that he
had seen some of these Roulers so strong and perfect,
as if they had been made but Yesterday. With these
they bound and swath’d the dead Body, beginning at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the Head and ending with the Feet. Over these again
they wound others, so often one upon another, that
there could not be less than a 1000 ells upon one
Body. They interwove these Roulers so artificially
and in such manner, says <i>Kircher</i>, as would puzzle the
Ingenuity and tire the Industry of our Modern <i>Surgeons</i>
to find out, yet, with submission to him, it may
not be so difficult to perform by any one tollerably
skill’d in the <i>Art</i> of <i>Bandage</i> as he imagines, for, as I
take it, they began with the Feet and Hands, and ended
with the Head, contrary to what <i>Greaves</i> asserts, tho’
I cannot say this of my own Knowledge, having never
had any opportunity of unrouling such Bodies, but
only offer the Consideration thereof, according to the
appearance of the following Figures, of which the first
shows the interior artificial Circumvolutions of the
Roulers, the Body being first wrapp’d in fine Linnen,
wherein <i>Egypt</i> excell’d, as the Holy Scriptures testifie,
<i>Prov.</i> 7. 16. &amp;c. The second Figure represents the
manner of the next Rouling, and the fourth shews the
external Ornaments, painted with <i>Hierogliphics</i>, &amp;c.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Designer</i> or <i>Painter</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For when the Body was thus roul’d, the <i>Designer</i> or
<i>Painter</i> cover’d the superficies of the Roulers with
a kind of Paste or Gum, on which he gilded and
painted Cyphers, Figures, Letters, Characters and other
<i>Hieroglyphics</i>. The third Figure shows a Case to keep
the Body in, made of Linnen, and painted in like manner
with <i>Hieroglyphics</i> in distinct Colours, having been
found in the <i>Musæum</i> of <i>Johannes Nardius</i>. Now concerning
the nature and signification of these <i>Hieroglyphics</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Hieroglyphic</i> Characters.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Authors variously write; but none have taken
so much Pains, or div’d so far into the meaning of
them, as the Learned <i>Kircher</i>, who pretends to explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>all the <i>Hieroglyphic</i> Characters painted on the Roulers
and Coffins of the <i>Mummies</i>, in his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oedipi Ægyptiaci
Theatrum Hieroglyphicum</span></cite>, where also, <i>p.</i> 412 and 414.
you may find the particular Explanations of the third
and fourth Figures. But since there remains no Alphabet
or Dictionary of these Characters (for the entire
Knowledge of <i>Hieroglyphics</i> perish’d at the Time
the <i>Egyptian</i> Ceremonies ceas’d, and were abolish’d by
the Irruption <i>Cambyses</i> made into <i>Egypt</i>) we believe
all those assiduous Penetrations into these Mysteries by
<i>Kircher</i> and <i>R. P. Menestrier</i>, are but imperfect Conjectures
and meer Imaginations. However, having
spoken of the <i>Egyptian</i> Language in no part of this
Book before, it may not be amiss to insert here some
few Particulars concerning it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two sorts of <i>Languages</i> and <i>Characters</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
First then, there were
two sorts of Languages and Characters among the
<i>Egyptians</i>; one common and us’d by all, constituted for
their Trade and Commerce with Mankind, and which
was that Tongue or Idiom call’d the <i>Coptic</i> or <i>Pharonic</i>,
and the other us’d only by Priests, Prophets,
<i>Hierogrammatists</i> or Holy Writers, and the like Persons
in Sacerdotal Orders. The first was written from the
Right Hand to the Left in Characters not unlike the
old <i>Greek</i>; but the latter consisted not of Letters, Syllables
or Words, but thro’ the Image and Pictures of
Things, they endeavour’d to deliver their hidden Conceits
in the Letters and Language of Nature. Thus
by a representation of the several Parts and Actions of
Man, the shape of Artificers Tools and Instruments,
the form of all sorts of Animals, Beasts, Birds and
Fish, the resemblance of the Sun, Moon, Planets and
the like, they exactly read and understood every thing
couch’d within those <i>Hieroglyphics</i>. For Example, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Crocodile was the Emblem of Malice; the Eye the
Preserver of Justice and the Guard of the Body; the
Right Hand, with its Fingers open, signify’d Plenty,
and the Left, with its Fingers clos’d, Preservation and
Custody of Mens Goods and Estates. To express their
<i>Eneph</i> or Creator of the World, the <i>Egyptians</i> describ’d
an old Man in a blew Mantle, with an Egg in
his Mouth, which was the Emblem of the World, and
express’d their Notion of Divinity by an Eye on a
Scepter, by an Eagle’s Head, <i>&amp;c.</i> Of which see more
in Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i>’s <i>Vulgar Errors</i>, cap. 20. where he
rightly observes, that of all Nations that suffer’d by
the Confusion of <i>Babel</i>, the <i>Egyptians</i> found the best
Evasion; for tho’ Words were confounded, they invented
a Language of Things, and spake to each other
by common Notions in Nature, whereby they discours’d
in silence, and were intuitively understood
from the Theory of their Impressions; for they assum’d
the shapes of Animals common to all Eyes, and by
their Conjunctions and Compositions were able to communicate
their Conception to any that co-apprehended
the <i>Syntaxis</i> of their Natures. This many conceive
to have been the Primitive way of Writing, and
of greater Antiquity than Letters; and this Language
indeed might <i>Adam</i> well have spoken, who understanding
the Nature of Things, had the advantage of Natural
Expressions, <i>&amp;c.</i> But to add two or three Examples
more out of <i>Orus</i>: For Eternity the <i>Egyptians</i>
painted the Sun and Moon, as Things which they believ’d
to have had no beginning, nor were likely to
have any ending; for a Year they painted a Snake with
his Tail in his Mouth, to show how, one Year succeeding
another, the World was still kept in an endless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Circle; for a Month they painted a Palm-Tree, by
reason at every new Moon that Tree sends forth a
new Branch; for <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> they painted a Falcon, as
well in that he soars so exceeding high, as that he
governs the lesser Birds, for Integrity of Life they
painted Fire and Water, both because these Elements
are in themselves most pure, and by reason all other
Things are purify’d by them; for any thing that was
abominable to the Gods they painted a Fish, because in
their Sacrifices the Priests never us’d them, and the like
of which you will find innumerable Instances in <i>Pierius</i>’s
Book of the <i>Egyptian Hieroglyphics</i>. Now what so
great a number of these Sacred Characters inscrib’d
on their <i>Obelisks</i> and <i>Mummies</i> signify’d, Authors seem
to differ about, some looking on them as <i>Charms</i> and
<i>Necromancy</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Hieroglyphics</i>, their <i>Signification</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and others thinking they did thereby endeavour
not so much to express as hide their Meanings,
to amuse and awe the Vulgar; but I am more
inclinable to think they always contain’d some History
of the Life and Death, Virtues and Actions of the
Deceas’d, or else some Religious Ceremonies, and the
like; for <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, Lib. 1. cap. 4. writes of <i>Sesoosis</i>,
that he erected two Obelisks of polish’d Marble
120 Cubits high, on which were inscrib’d a Description
of the large extent of his Empire, the great
Value of his Revenue, and the number of the Nations
by him conquer’d; and what sort of Writing
this was, is explain’d a little before, where, speaking of
the like Works, he says, he erected Pillars whereon
were inscrib’d in <i>Egyptian</i> Letters call’d <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
these Words: Sesoosis <i>King of Kings and Lord of Lords
subdu’d this Country by his Arms</i>. Also <i>Lib.</i> 5. <i>cap.</i> 3.
he writes of a Golden Pillar whereon were Letters inscrib’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>call’d by the <i>Egyptians</i> Sacred Writing, expressing
the famous Actions of <i>Uranus</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Diana</i>
and <i>Apollo</i>, written, as they say, by <i>Mercury</i> himself,
whom most Authors agree with him to have been the
first Inventor of these <i>Hieroglyphic Characters</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dresses</i> and <i>Ornaments</i> of the <i>Mummies</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>But to return to the manner of <i>dressing</i> and <i>adorning</i>
the <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, such as is represented in Figure
the 4th, where you may see the Image and Form of a
Woman set off with various Ornaments, the signification
of whose <i>Hieroglyphic Characters</i> you have explain’d
by <i>Kircher</i>, in the Book and Page before-mention’d;
we shall next proceed to give an account of an
extraordinary fine <i>Mummy</i> which <i>Pietro della Valle</i> saw
and describes in this manner, <i>viz.</i> That upon it was
the Figure of a young Man, dress’d in a long Gown,
gilded and sprinkl’d over with <i>Hieroglyphic</i> Emblems
from Head to Foot, set off with precious Stones, with
the Hair of his Head black and curl’d, and his Beard
of the same colour, but short; a Chain of Gold hung
about his Neck, having a Medal with the Image of
the Bird <i>Ibis</i> on it, with many other Marks and Characters,
which give us to understand this young Man
was possess’d of great Dignities. In his Right Hand
he held a Golden Bason full of red Liquor, and in his
Left a Fruit somewhat resembling an Apple: He had a
Gold-Ring on his Thumb, and another on his little
Finger, likewise Sandals which cover’d the Soles of his
Feet only, and were ty’d above the Instep with Straps
or Latchets. On a Fillet or Rouler hanging at his
Girdle, one might plainly read the word <i>Eutichi</i>,
which signifies <i>Good Time</i>. By his side was a Woman
yet more richly and mysteriously adorn’d, with an Ox,
the Image of <i>Apis</i> or <i>Isis</i>, at her Feet. In a word,
both these Figures were painted like to the Saints of the
Ancients. When the dead Bodies of the <i>Egyptians</i> were
<i>Embalm’d</i>, roul’d, painted and adorn’d after the manner
we have describ’d, as you may partly see at Figures
the first, second and fourth, they put them into Cases
or Coffins made of Linnen pasted to a great thickness,
or else of Wood carv’d in the similitude and likeness
of the Person deceas’d, as you may see at Figures the
third and fifth; the first of which shows the back part
of a Linnen-Case for a <i>Mummy</i>, painted with several
Colours, as is to be seen in the Collection of <i>Johannes
Nardius</i>; and the other how a roul’d Body lies plac’d
in a wooden Coffin, as may be seen in the <i>Musæum</i> of
the Great Duke of <i>Tuscany</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Coffins</i> of <i>Sycamore</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>These Coffins were sometimes made of <i>Cedar</i>, but
most commonly of <i>Sycamore</i>, a large Tree, very plentifully
growing in <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Judæa</i>, which bears
Leaves like to the <i>Mulberry</i>-Tree, but larger, and Fruit
like to a Fig, not sprouting from the Branches, but from
the Stock or Body of the Tree. ’Tis call’d by us the <i>Egyptian</i>
Fig, by them <i>Giumez</i>. Its Leaves afford a pleasant
shade, its Fruit refreshment to such as Travel in
the Plains of those hot Countries, and its Wood serves
not only for Coffins but Buildings. ’Tis also a Tree
so lasting and well rooted, that the <i>Sycamore</i> which
<i>Zacheus</i> ascended, is still shown in <i>Judæa</i> to Travellers,
as is also the hollow <i>Sycamore</i> at <i>Matarea</i> in <i>Egypt</i>,
where the Blessed Virgin is said to have remain’d for
some Time, which tho’ it savour of the Legend, says
Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i> in his Observations on <cite>Scripture-Plants</cite>,
p. 12. yet it plainly shows what Opinion the <i>Egyptians</i>
had of the lasting Condition of this Tree to countenance
their Tradition, of which likewise they might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>not be without some Experience, since the Learned
<i>Greaves</i> observes, <i>p.</i> 57. that the old <i>Egyptians</i> made
Coffins of this Wood, of which there are many frequently
found among the <i>Mummies</i>, very fair, entire
and free from Corruption even at this Day, nay after
the Revolution perhaps of 3000 Years. Of these Coffins
<i>Greaves</i> tells us, <i>p.</i> 50. he had seen many fashion’d
after the likeness of a Man, or rather resembling one
of those <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, which, as we have describ’d
before, are bound about with Fillets or Roulers, and
wrapp’d in a Shroud of Linnen; for as in those there
is the shape of a Head, with a kind of painted Vizard
or Mask fastned to them, but without any appearance
of their Arms or Legs, in like manner is it with these
Coffins, the Lids of which have the shape of the Head
of a Man, with a Face painted on it resembling a
Woman, the residue being one continued Trunk. At
the end of this Trunk is a Pedestal somewhat broad, on
which it stood upright in the Reconditory, as <cite>Herodotus</cite>
relates. Some of these Coffins are handsomly painted
without with several <i>Hieroglyphics</i>; opening two of
them he found within, over the Body,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Scroles</i> painted with <i>Characters</i>, &amp;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
divers Scroles
fastned to the Linnen-Shroud: These were painted
with Sacred <i>Characters</i>, in Colours very lively and fresh,
among which were, in a larger size, the Pictures both
of Men and Women, some headed like Hawks, others
like Dogs, <i>&amp;c.</i> These Scroles ran either down the
Belly and Sides, or else were plac’d on the Knees and
Legs. On the Feet was a Linnen-Cover (and so were
all the Scroles before-mention’d of Linnen, it being
not lawful for them to use Woollen) painted with
<i>Hieroglyphics</i>, and fashion’d like a high Slipper. On
the Breast was a kind of Breast-Plate, made with folds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>of Linnen cut Scallop-wise, richly painted and gilt.
In the midst of the bend at the top, was the Face of a
Woman with her Arms extended, on each side, at
the two outmost ends, was the Head of a Hawk fairly
gilt, by which they represented the Divine Nature.
Thus far <i>Greaves</i>. Moreover <i>Thevenot</i>, <i>Bellonius</i>, <i>Nardius</i>
and others observe,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Several things found included in the <i>Mummies</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that the <i>Egyptians</i> were wont
to put within the Cavities of the Breasts and Bellies of
their <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, such Things as they generally
lov’d most in their Life-Time, <i>viz.</i> Books, Writings,
Arms, Medals, Money and pieces of Antiquity, little
Vessels, or any sort of antient Houshold-Goods; also
little Idols and Images of the Gods which they Worshipp’d
whilst alive, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Kircher</i> tells us in his <cite>Oedipus
Ægyptiacus Theatr. Hierogl.</cite> p. 420. that <i>Nardius</i> sent
him two Roulers mark’d with <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, and roul’d
up in the manner of a Scrole, taken out of the Breast
or Belly of a Mummy; adding also that the <i>Egyptians</i>
did not only look on such <i>Hieroglyphics</i> as Symbols
of the greatest Secrecy, but also that they had a power
to obtain Protection of those Gods to whom they
were fastned, and that these Roulers signify’d nothing
else but the Funeral Pomp, which was perform’d as
magnificently as possible, especially if it were of a King,
Priest or the like, the Explanation whereof see in the
Page above-mention’d. <i>Gulielmus Rondeletus</i>, a Physician
of <i>Montpelier</i>, kept as a great Rarity 20 Leaves
of antient Paper,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>as <i>Papers</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
taken out of the Breast of a <i>Mummy</i>,
which was fill’d with old <i>Arabic</i> Letters, yet none could
read it, tho’ the <i>Jews</i> of <i>Avignon</i> conjectur’d it contain’d
the Life of the Deceas’d; but nothing is so commonly
found in these Mummies, as Idols of various
sizes, tho’ generally about half a Foot or a Span long,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>form’d either of Potters Earth, glaz’d or varnish’d and
bak’d, or else of Stone, Metal, Wood or the like.
Some of all these kinds Mr. <i>Greaves</i> brought over, and
particularly mentions one cut out of a <i>Magnes</i> or
Loadstone, in the form and bigness of a <i>Scarabæus</i>:
See <i>p.</i> 48. of his <i>Pyramidographia</i>. <i>Camerarius</i>, <i>Horar.
subcisivar.</i> Cent. 1. cap. 14. speaks more remarkably of
those made of Brass,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Brass-Images</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
affirming they were chiefly us’d
in that manner, by reason they had great Virtue to
preserve dead Bodies from Putrifaction, especially,
since <i>Pierius</i> in his Book of <i>Hieroglyphics</i> witnesses,
that Brass-Nails were stuck into the Body for the same
purpose; but this is not to be credited by any one
physically skill’d in the Virtues of Minerals, <i>&amp;c.</i> We
have more reason to believe these Idols were so plac’d
out of Superstition, especially seeing many are the Figures
of <i>Isis</i>, <i>Osiris</i>, and other Gods; nor did they only
place them in the inside of dead Bodies, but also
hung them there on the out-side, sewing them to the
Roulers and Ornaments, and likewise plac’d them in
their Sepulchres: These from their Office or Use were
distinguish’d by several Names,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Averruncal</i> and<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
such as <i>Averruncal</i> or
<i>Apotropæan</i> Gods, so call’d because they were thought
to avert Evil;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Prophylactic</i> Statues.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
others were term’d <i>Prophylactic</i> Statues
or Portable <i>Amulets</i>, which they carry’d as Charms
about their Necks, Arms and Girdles; and a third sort,
in general Esteem among them,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Serapes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
were the <i>Serapes</i>, the
same with what the <i>Hebrews</i> call’d <i>Teraphim</i>, the <i>Latins</i>,
<i>Penates</i> and <i>Lares</i>, being <i>Tutelar</i> Gods, appointed to
defend and keep certain Places, and some of these they
carry’d along with them where-ever they went. Of
this number were <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Nepthe</i>, <i>Horus</i>, <i>Harpocrates</i>,
<i>Arveris</i>, <i>Apopis</i> and innumerable others of the like kind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>which altho’ they were all in the Nature of <i>Genii</i>, and
the same in Substance, differing only in their Effects,
yet, says <i>Kircher</i>, as they were deputed to the Custody
of private Things, so they obtain’d the Name of <i>Tutelar</i>
Gods, and were accordingly Worshipp’d for private
Deities. Thus some were Country-Gods, others
Defenders of Cities, and a third sort Keepers of private
Houses. There have been great numbers of these
brought out of <i>Egypt</i>, of various sizes and compos’d of
different Matter, such as Earth, Stone, Wood, Metal or the
like,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their <i>Forms</i> and <i>Actions</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
differing both in Form and Actions, some appearing
like <i>Mummies</i> and roul’d up in the same manner,
others with deform’d and threatning Countenances
thereby to strike an awe and terrifie, to which purpose
they held various Instruments in their Hands, such as
Hooks and Harping-Irons, Sheilds, Whips, and the like;
but all these kinds of Statues were adorn’d with <i>Hieroglyphic</i>
Characters both before and behind, nay, some
all over, whence they came to be call’d <i>Polycharacteristic</i>
Statues, of which you may see above 50 several
Figures, with their Descriptions, in <i>Kircher</i>’s Book before-mention’d,
<i>Syntagma</i> 16, 17, 18 and 19. I shall
here therefore only insert two Plates out of <i>Johannes
Nardius</i>’s Annotations on <i>Lucretius</i>, whereof all the
Statues and Figures were in his own Custody and <i>Musæum</i>,
and of which the first Plate represents the foreside
and backside of eight Wooden Images, without
either Arms or Legs, adorn’d in a manner with the
same Dresses, Ornaments and Characters as the <i>Mummies</i>,
about a Cubit and half long, which the <i>Egyptians</i>
were wont to place on their Tombs and Coffins, as
may be seen at <i>p.</i> 203. The 9th Figure shews a
Linnen Ornament for the Breast, distinctly painted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>with divers Colours, wherein was express’d the true
way of opening Bodies in order to their <i>Embalming</i>;
from which also appears, that they open’d the <i>Thorax</i>,
tho’ neither <cite>Herodotus</cite> nor <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> make any
mention thereof. The 10th Figure shews an Alabaster-Urn
or Pot mark’d with <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, and fill’d with
<i>Asphalt</i>, with which they us’d to <i>Embalm</i> their Bodies,
and the 11th is the Cover of the Pot with a Dog’s
Head on it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The second Plate represents such Figures as the
<i>Egyptians</i> hung on their <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, which were
made of glaz’d and colour’d Earth, or else of Brass:
The first nine are deform’d, with horrid Countenances,
either of Men or Animals, some joyning their Hands,
others bearing on their Knees, or else hanging them
down. The 1st and 9th, which look most terrible
with a Lion’s Countenance, represent the <i>Mophtæi
Genii</i>; the 2d has the Face of the Dog <i>Anubis</i>; the
3d and 7th have the monstrous Beards of the Priests of
<i>Isis</i>; the 4th and 6th are the <i>Nepthæi</i>; the 5th represents
<i>Horus</i>, a Boy with a monstrous Head; the 8th
has the Face of a Boy likewise, with a loop-hole on the
Back, to sew it to the <i>Mummies</i>, as have also the 1st,
2d, 4th, 6th, 20th, 21st and 25th Figures, tho’ not
altogether so conspicuous. The 12th and 14th, as
also the 19th and 25th are the same, with the 1st and
9th, signifying the <i>Genii Mophtæi</i>; the 11th and 15th
are the same with the 4th and 6th; the 16th,  21st and
23d carry great Stones on their Heads and Shoulders,
as it were threatning to fling them at such as offer’d
to disturb them, or else to bury them under them;
the 10th is a <i>Scarabæus</i>; the 13th a <i>Phallus occulatus</i>,
which they carry’d about with them as one of the
greatest <i>Amulets</i> they could use against Sterility; the
17th and 18th are two Crocodiles, likewise carry’d
along with them to appease <i>Typhon</i>; the 20th and
24th with Hawks Heads represent <i>Osiris</i>; the 22d is
most monstrous of all, carrying a Bushel on its Head,
all the Figure being compos’d of Head and Belly. It
denotes <i>Serapis</i>, of whom they say there was a Statue
in <i>Alexandria</i> of that Magnitude, that it touch’d both
sides of the <i>Serapian</i> Temple; the 26th is <i>Harpocrates</i>
holding his Finger on his Mouth, to shew the Silence
religiously observ’d by the <i>Egyptians</i> in their Mysteries;
the 27th is the Ox <i>Apis</i>, before describ’d <i>p.</i> 200, and
the 28th the Statue of <i>Isis</i>, giving Suck to her Son
<i>Horus</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>These were the true <i>Phylacteric</i> and <i>Averruncal</i> Statues
of the <i>Egyptians</i>, some made portable with Handles,
and others with a square piece of Wood proceeding
from their Pedestal, whereby they were the better fix’d
on Tombs. Some again were put within the Bellies of
the Mummies, and others hung about the outsides of
them, and that as well to preserve the Bodies from
Putrifaction as the Sepulchres from Rapine,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their <i>Use</i> and <i>Virtues</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which they
were suppos’d to effect by their Divine Power, or Magical
Virtue, or else by their terrible and deform’d
Countenances were thought to strike a Dread into
every approaching Adversary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the Body being <i>Embalm’d</i> and adorn’d with
<i>Hieroglyphic</i> Characters, magical Amulets, Statues and
the like, and every thing else got ready for the Funeral,
it was on the last Day or Time appointed for the Burial,
put on board a Ship call’d <i>Barris</i>, and by the
Ferry-Man, <i>Charon</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Charon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wafted o’er the Lake <i>Acherusia</i>;
which lies on the <i>South</i> side of <i>Memphis</i>, where being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>landed on a Plain, the chief Burial-Place of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
and which is fabl’d by the <i>Greeks</i> to be the <i>Elysian</i>
Fields, they plac’d the Corps on a Bier, before
the Mouth of the Sepulchre, when the Judges, Priests
and common People surrounding it,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Manner of <i>Judging</i> the <i>Dead</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
one who was
purposely appointed to rehearse impartially the <i>Funeral-Oration</i>,
openly declar’d the Virtues, Vices and Actions,
nay whole Life and Conversation of the Deceas’d, and
after all the Evidences were examin’d (every one having
a free power to accuse the dead Person) according to the
majority of Votes and judgment of the Judges, the
Corps was dispos’d of. If he had liv’d Virtuously he
was honour’d with the greatest Praises and Commendations,
and consequently magnificently Interr’d; but
if Viciously, he was mightily exclaim’d against and
depriv’d of Sepulture. This made even the Kings
themselves to live uprightly, fearing so much as to
anger the common People whilst alive, lest they should
thereby incur their eternal Hatred after their Death.
This Custom of the <i>Egyptians</i> examining and trying
their Dead, <i>Bossuet</i> in his History of the World, <i>p.</i> 457,
takes notice of as a very extraordinary kind of Judgment
which none escap’d, affirming, ‘It was a Consolation
at the Time of Death to leave their Names
in esteem among Men, and of all Human Blessings,
this was the only one which Death cannot ravish from
us; but it was not suffer’d in <i>Egypt</i> to commend all
the Dead indifferently, that was an Honour to be had
only from a public Judgment. The public Accuser
was heard, if he prov’d the Conduct of the Deceas’d
bad, then was his Memory condemn’d and he depriv’d
of Sepulture. The People admir’d the power
of their Laws, which reach’d them even after Death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and every one being touch’d by the Example, was
afraid to dishonour his Memory and Family: But
if the Defunct was not convicted of any Crime,
then had he an honourable Interment. They made
his Panegyric, but medled not in the least with his
Birth: All <i>Egypt</i> was Noble, and besides, they receiv’d
no farther Commendations than what they
had got by their Merits. Moreover, the <i>Egyptians</i>
were very curious in Preserving dead Bodies: Thus
their Gratitude to their Kindred became Immortal.
Children, by seeing the Bodies of their Ancestors, call’d
to mind their Virtues, which the Public had made
such Acknowledgements to, and they were incited to
love those Laws which had so recommended them
to them. This Custom of Judging Kings after their
Deaths, says he <i>p.</i> 457. seem’d so holy to the People
of <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>, that they have always practis’d it. We
read in the Scriptures wicked Kings have been depriv’d
of the Burial of their Ancestors; and we learn
from <i>Josephus</i>, that that Custom lasted even to the
Time of the <i>Asmoneans</i>: This gave Kings to understand,
that tho’ their Majesty put them above Human
Judgments whilst alive, yet were they not above
them when Death had equall’d them with
other Men. Likewise our Author further adds,
<i>p.</i> 454. That to prevent borrowing, which was
the Parent of Idleness, Frauds and Branglings, the
Decree of King <i>Asychis</i> did not suffer any to borrow,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pawning</i> the
<i>Dead</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but on condition he pawn’d the Body of his Ancestor
to him of whom he borrow’d; and it was reputed
both an Impiety and Infamy together not to redeem
it so soon as ever he could, so precious a Pledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>was it reckon’d, and he that dy’d before he had acquitted
himself of that Duty, was deny’d Burial.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Now how the Bodies, which are said to have been
bury’d, were laid up, is somewhat difficult to determine,
since Authors speak so variously of their Burial;
for some say they were bury’d either in their
private or proper Sepulchres, or else in a public Reconditory,
and others say they kept the Dead in their
Dwelling-Houses. Now which of these was most
us’d by such as could indifferently afford the Expence
of either, I will not pretend to determine, however,
the great variety of Sepulchres, found even at this
Day, plainly proves they bury’d in the Fields and
Plains, whereas the other is but traditionally asserted,
yet not altogether improbable to be done by so Superstitious
a People, of whom it is reported that some,
especially the richer Sort, put their <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies
in Cases carv’d after their own likeness,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Dead</i> kept in <i>Houses</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and these
they set up in their Halls or Parlours in great Order
(perhaps in Niches) being very richly adorn’d, where
they took great delight to see a long Race of their
Ancestors, in a manner, with as great satisfaction as if
they were alive, and they were Conversing with them.
Nay, <cite>Herodotus</cite>, <i>Pomponius Mela</i> and <i>Lucian</i> assert,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and plac’d at <i>Table</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they plac’d them at Table like Guests, and made
merry with them by Eating and Drinking; yet, when
they were necessitous, they scrupl’d not to give them
as a Pledge for Money they borrow’d, yet then took
particular Care, both punctually to pay the one and
redeem the other: But as for such as bury’d their
Dead out of their Houses and Villages, in the Fields
and Plains, they built Sepulchres for them as noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>as possible, some after one Fashion, and some after another,
every one according to their own Fancy, or the
Charges they could best spare; for they chose rather
to have their Monuments magnificently built than
their Dwelling-Houses, laughing at the <i>Greeks</i> and
other Nations, who caus’d theirs to be rais’d with
great expence like to Palaces, notwithstanding they
were to live but a very little while in them, and at the
same time neglected their Tombs, where they were
to lye for a much longer Time. But the <i>Egyptians</i>
acted just contrary; they despis’d the present Life,
and took little care in building their Habitations,
looking upon them only as so many Inns or Baiting-Places,
where they were to Inhabit but for a Season,
whereas the Glory of a future Life, that was to
be procur’d by Virtue, they greatly esteem’d, and
consequently spent their whole Care, Study and Riches
about the magnificence of their Sepulchres,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sepulchres</i> call’d <i>Eternal Houses</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which
they call’d Sempiternal or Eternal Houses, looking
upon the Time they were to dwell here on Earth
as nothing, in respect of the stay they were to make
in the Grave. And hence it is no Nation in the
World has been so curious as the <i>Egyptians</i> in their
Funeral Ceremonies, Preserving the Dead, and magnificence
of Sepulchres, which, besides abundance of
private Structures, those Obelisks at <i>Rome</i> and the
Pyramids of <i>Egypt</i>, do not only testifie, but will
for ever be numbred among the Wonders of the
World.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>In considering the Nature of the <i>Egyptian Pyramids</i>,
<i>Subterranean Vaults</i> and <i>Lamps</i>, I not
only found in them much Magnificence, but
more Curiosity, insomuch that tho’ the first
were justly reputed Wonders of the World, yet are
the last as surprizing and unaccountable, even to the
most inquisitive Naturalist, or expert Chymist. Now
well knowing your incomparable Library contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the most curious Books wrote on this Subject, as also
that your unparalell’d <i>Musæum</i> is furnish’d with a
great variety of Lamps, Lacrimatories, Averruncal
Gods, and the like Rarities, taken out of the <i>Pyramids</i>
and Subterranean Places of <i>Egypt</i>, I thought it not
only proper to beg your Patronage of the following
Sheets, but likewise believ’d my self oblig’d to return
such Acknowledgments for your many Favours as I was
best able to make, in as much as you are both a great
Promoter of Arts and Sciences in general, and have
more particularly been pleas’d to encourage this Work
of mine: But as to write a Panegyric on your Merit
and Virtues would look too much like Flattery, so,
entirely to pass them by without taking any notice
of them, would no less savour of Ingratitude, therefore
I must needs desire leave to say, That the Judgment
of the Royal Society, Men of the most polite
Learning in the World, in choosing you for their
Secretary, is a sufficient Argument of your great
Worth and acute Discernment; but your Candour
will appear in nothing so much as in accepting this
succinct Account of the <i>Pyramids</i>, Subterranean Vaults
and Lamps of the <i>Egyptians</i>, whilst you have by you
the Learned Mr. <i>Greaves</i>’s <i>Pyramidographia</i>, with the
several Accounts of <i>Licetus</i>, <i>Bellori</i>, and other Writers
about <i>Lamps</i>, &amp;c. Now whereas in the foregoing
Letter was fully shown the manner of preparing dead
Bodies and rendring them durable, in this I chiefly
intend to speak of the Sepulchres or Repositories
wherein they were laid; for as much as the <i>Egyptians</i>
did not only content themselves with <i>Embalming</i> their
Dead, but likewise with equal Care provided Conditories
that might be lasting as the Body, and in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>it might continue safe from the Injuries both of Time
and Men, because they religiously believ’d that so long
as the Body indur’d, so long would the Soul continue
with it, not as a quickning or animating Spirit, but
as an Attendant or Guardian, and without going into
any other Body, as otherwise they thought it would;
so that after they had preserv’d the Dead from Putrifaction,
they next entomb’d them in firm and stately
Monuments, such as were at first those Mercurial Sepulchres
of hard Marble of a Spherical Figure, as
<i>Strabo</i> records, and those wonderful ones of the antient
Kings of <i>Thebes</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, which <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>,
Lib. 1. mentions, and such were also the <i>Hypogæa</i>,
those Caves or Dormitories cut out in the <i>Lybian</i> Desarts,
by the <i>Egyptians</i> of lower Quality, which are
now term’d the Mummies. Of the same Nature likewise
are the stately <i>Pyramids</i> built by their Kings,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pyramids</i> to what end built.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
all
being design’d to secure the Dead, after they were
<i>Embalm’d</i>, from the Injuries of the <i>Nile</i> or Weather,
the rapine of an Enemy or any voracious Animal;
and that so the Soul might be still oblig’d to attend
them: But besides this general Reason why these Reconditories
were built, which was to preserve the
Dead from all external Violence,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Why of a <i>Pyramidal</i> form.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
there were two
special ones why they were made in a <i>Pyramidal</i>
form. The first was, in that this Figure appears most
permanent and durable, as being neither so liable to
be over-press’d by its own weight at top, nor to be
undermin’d by the sinking in of Rain at the bottom, as
other Buildings are. The second was, because these
Structures were intended to represent some of the <i>Egyptian</i>
Deities; for, in the most antient Times, <i>Pyramidal</i>
Columns or Obelisks were worshipp’d as Images
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>of the Gods, before the exact Art of Carving Statues
was found out, and so as <i>Isis Cornigera</i> represented the
Horns of the Moon, in like manner might these <i>Pyramids</i>
represent the Rays of the Sun, which the <i>Egyptians</i>
worshipp’d under the name of <i>Osiris</i>. As to
the number of <i>Pyramids</i> to be seen in <i>Egypt</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their number.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Bellonius</i>
very much exceeds the Account given us by other
Travellers, for he makes them above 100, whereas
<i>Greaves</i> says there are not 20, and Prince <i>Radzivil</i>
reckon’d but 17. Three of these are the most remarkable,
being built on <i>Africa</i> side,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Scituation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
on a rocky and
barren Hill, between the City <i>Memphis</i> and the Place
call’d <i>Delta</i>, from the <i>Nile</i> less than four Miles, from
<i>Memphis</i> six, and near to <i>Busiris</i>, a Village from whence
People are wont to ascend up to them, <cite>Pliny</cite> Lib. 36.
cap. 12. <i>Le Bruyn</i> has given us this Drawing of them,
together with the <i>Sphinx</i> which he made on the spot,
whilst the <i>French</i> Consul and some of his Company
were refreshing themselves under its Shade.</p>

<p class='c009'>These three <i>Pyramids</i> were not erected by the <i>Israelites</i>,
under the Tyranny of the <i>Pharaohs</i>, as <i>Josephus</i>
and some modern Writers affirm; for the Scripture
says positively, the Slavery of the <i>Jews</i> consisted in
making and burning Brick, whereas all these <i>Pyramids</i>
were made of Stone. The first and greatest of them
was built,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Who were the <i>Founders</i> of them.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
says <cite>Herodotus</cite>, by <i>Cheops</i> (stil’d by <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i>, <i>Chemmis</i>) who succeeded <i>Rhampsinitus</i> in the
Kingdom of <i>Egypt</i>. He adds, that the Stones were
dug out of the Quarries of an <i>Arabian</i> Mountain, and
from thence carry’d to the <i>Nile</i>; that there were employ’d
in the Work Ten Miriads or a Hundred Thousand
Men, every Three Months a Myriad; that the
whole <i>Pyramid</i> was finish’d in 20 Years, whereof 10
were spent in conveying the Stones to the Place of
building.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_362.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The second <i>Pyramid</i>, like the first in respect to its
Workmanship, but far inferior in regard of its Magnitude,
was built by the Successor to <i>Cheops</i>, who was
<i>Cephren</i> his Brother, as <cite>Herodotus</cite> and <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>
agree.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third <i>Pyramid</i>, less than either of the two former,
was built by <i>Mycerinus</i>, Son of <i>Cheops</i> or <i>Chemmis</i>,
says <cite>Herodotus</cite>. Other Writers give different
Names to the Founders of these <i>Pyramids</i>; but this
is what is most probable among their various Opinions,
according to Mr. <i>Greaves</i>. Besides these three
now in being, <cite>Herodotus</cite> mentions a fourth built of
Brick by <i>Asychis</i>, who succeeded <i>Mycerinus</i>, and another
in which <i>Imandes</i> was bury’d, at the end of the
Labyrinth built by the 12 Kings of <i>Egypt</i>. Also long
before any of these, <i>Mœris</i> in his wonderful Lake, had
erected two <i>Pyramids</i>, one for himself and another
for his Wife, both long since gone to ruine; but there
are many yet standing in the <i>Lybian</i> Desart, whose
Founders none of the antient Writers have ever nam’d.
Among these one is no less worthy of Memory than
either of the three former, it standing about 20 Miles
distant from them, more within the sandy Desart, and
appearing to have the same Dimensions, the same
Steps without as the first has, to be of the same Colour,
and to have an Entrance like it on the North
side, which is barr’d up within, and so whatever is
said of the first in respect to its out-side may be applicable
to this last, therefore one Description may serve
for both.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Description of the first and fairest <i>Pyramid</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>The first and fairest of the three great <i>Pyramids</i> is
scituate on the top of a rocky Hill, in the sandy Desart
of <i>Lybia</i>, about a quarter of a Mile distant Westward
from the Plains of <i>Egypt</i>, the height of the scituation
giving Beauty as the solidity of the Rock does
firmness to the Superstructure. The Basis is exactly
four square, and the North side of it being measur’d
by Mr. <i>Greaves</i> with a <i>Radius</i> of 10 Foot, was found
to be 693 <i>English</i> Foot, and the Altitude being measur’d
by its Perpendicular, was found to be 481 Foot;
but if taken as it ascends inclining, then is it equal to
the Basis, which is 693 Foot. To give a true Idea of
the just Dimensions of this <i>Pyramid</i>, we must imagine
on the sides of the Basis, which is exactly square, four
equilateral Triangles mutually propending, till they
all meet at the top as it were in a point; for so the
<i>Perimeter</i> of each Triangle comprehending 2079 Foot,
and the <i>Perimeter</i> of the Basis 2772 Foot, the whole
Area of the Basis will contain 480249 square Foot, or
about 11 <i>English</i> Acres of Ground, which is a Proportion
so monstrous, that it might seem incredible
were it not attested by the Ancients to be so much,
and by some of them more. The Ascent to the top
of the <i>Pyramid</i>, from all the sides without, is by Degrees
or Steps; the lowermost Degree is near four Foot
in height, and three in breadth, which goes about the
<i>Pyramid</i> in a level: The second Degree is like the first,
only it retires inward near three Foot; after the same
manner is the third Row, and so the rest, rising like
so many Stairs one above another to the top, which
ends not in a point, but in a little flat, and is about
13 Foot broad, being cover’d with nine Stones, besides
two which are wanting at the Angles. The Degrees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>by which we ascend are not of an equal depth,
for some are near four Foot, others want of three, and
the higher we ascend, the depth grows the less, and
so in proportion does the breadth also. These rows
of Stones are much impair’d by the Weather, yet
every Step, which is but one single Stone, is at least 30
cubical Feet; the number of Degrees from the bottom
to the top is 207 or 208. Some of the Ancients have
reported, that this <i>Pyramid</i> casts no Shadow, which
must be meant in the Summer-Time and at Mid-Day,
for in the Winter Mr. <i>Greaves</i> saw it cast a Shadow at
Noon. Thus far concerning the out-side or Superficies
of the greater <i>Pyramid</i>, with the Figure and Dimensions
of it; next Mr. <i>Greaves</i> gives a particular
Account of what he found within it, of which, if the
Ancients have been silent, he imputes it chiefly to a reverend
and awful Regard mix’d with Superstition, in
not presuming to enter those Chambers of Death,
which Religion and Devotion had consecrated to the
Rest and Quiet of the Dead. And first he tells us
how he ascended on the North side 38 Foot, on an
artificial Bank of Earth, when he and his Company
enter’d,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Entrance</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
with Tapers in their Hands, thro’ a square
narrow Passage three Foot broad and 92 long, the
Declivity of which was gradually so strait, that they
were forc’d, at the farther end, to creep on their Bellies.
After this, having pass’d thro’ a place in which
they found ugly large Bats above a Foot long, they
enter’d the first Gallery,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>First and second <i>Gallery</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Pavement of which was
of white and pollish’d Marble, rising with a gentle
Acclivity, being about five Foot broad, as many high,
and 110 Foot long: At the end of this begins the second
Gallery, a very stately piece of Work, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>inferiour, either in respect of the curiosity of Art or
richness of Materials, to the most sumptuous and magnificent
Buildings. ’Tis divided from the former by
a Wall, thro’ which they pass’d stooping along a
square hole, much about the same bigness as the entrance
of the <i>Pyramid</i>, but of no considerable length
yet level: At the end of this Hole on the right Hand,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Well</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they found the Well mention’d by <i>Pliny</i> to be 86 Cubits
in depth, into which, he probably imagines, the
Water of the River <i>Nile</i> was brought by some secret
Aqueduct, and <i>Bellonius</i> thinks, out of this Well
the Workmen drew the Water which they drank, as
likewise that it serv’d them to dilute the Mortar they
us’d in the Masons Work of the Building; but others
affirm, that after having descended 67 Foot strait downwards,
there is a square Window which leads into a
Grot or Cave dug out of a Hill found there, not of
living or solid Stone, but of Sand condens’d and
press’d together; it extends in length from East to
West 15 Foot lower, and consequently 82 from the
top. There is a Way dug in the Rock two Foot and
half wide, whose descent downwards is very crooked
the length of 123 Foot, at the end of which it is fill’d
with Sand and Bats nastiness: As ’tis said a <i>Scotch</i> Gentleman
found it out, of whom the <i>Sieur Thevenot</i>
makes mention in his Travels. <i>Le Bruyn</i> thinks it probable,
that this Well was made to let down the
Corps into, that were put in the Cavities that are under
the <i>Pyramids</i>, but would not venture the Experiment
of going down to see. <i>Greaves</i> also thinks this
Well was the Passage to those secret Vaults, mention’d,
but not describ’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite>, which were hewn out
of the natural Rock, over which this <i>Pyramid</i> was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>erected. This Well, says the former, is circular and
about three Foot over; the sides of it are lin’d with
white Marble, and the descent into it is by fixing the
Hands and Feet in little open spaces, cut into the sides
within, opposite and answerable to one another in a
perpendicular. But by his measure, sounding it with
a Line, he found it only 20 Foot deep, the rest, as he
supposes, has almost been damm’d up and choak’d
with Rubbage. Thence going strait forward the distance
of 15 Foot, they entred another square Passage,
opposite to the former and of the same bigness, the Stones
being very massy and exquisitely joyn’d; this led, at
the extent of 110 Foot, into an arch’d Vault or little
Chamber, standing East and West, about 20 Foot long,
17 broad and 15 high: The Walls were plaister’d
over with Lime, but the Roof was cover’d with large
smooth Stones, which lay shelving and met above in
a kind of Arch or rather Angle. Returning back the
same way they came, and being out of this low and
square Passage, they clim’d over it, and going strait on
in the trace of the second Gallery, on a shelving
Pavement (like that of the first) rising with an Angle
of 26 Degrees, they at length came to another Partition,
being 154 Foot distant from the Well below
and the length of the Gallery. Here if we consider
the narrow Entrance or Mouth of the <i>Pyramid</i> which
descends, and the length of the first and second Galleries
that ascend, all of them lying as it were in the
same continu’d Line, and leading towards the middle
of the <i>Pyramid</i>, one may easily apprehend the Reason
of that strange Eccho within of four or five Voices,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A strange <i>Eccho</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
mention’d by <i>Plutarch</i>, or rather of a long continued
Sound, as Mr. <i>Greaves</i> found by experience in discharging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>a Gun; for the Sound being carry’d thro’ those Passages,
and finding no vent outwards reflects on it self,
and causes a confus’d noise, which by degrees ceases.
This Gallery is built of white Marble, cut very exactly
into spacious squares and pollish’d; also the Roof and
sides of the Wall are of the same Stone, so closely
joynted as scarce to be discern’d by the most curious
Eye, and tho’ the acclivity or rising of the Ascent
make the Passage more difficult and slippery, yet is it
nevertheless very beautiful. The height of this Gallery
is 26 Foot, the breadth six, of which three are to
be allow’d for the way in the midst, which is set and
bounded on both sides with Seats (like Benches) of
pollish’d Stone; each of these is above one Foot in
breadth and no less in depth. On the top of these
Benches near the Angle, where they close and joyn
with the Wall, are little Spaces cut in right angl’d
parallel Figures, on each side opposite to one another,
intended, no doubt, for some other end than Ornament.
In casting and ranging the Marble in both
the side Walls, all the Courses, which are but seven,
(so great are those Stones) lye and flag over one another
about three Inches, as is better to be conceiv’d by
Figure 2 at <i>p.</i> 314. than by any Description I can
give.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Le Bruyn</i>’s Description of the <i>Gallery</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Le Bruyn</i> in his Voyage to the <cite>Levant</cite>, p. 139. writes
more particularly of this Gallery, after the following
manner: ‘Being return’d, says he, from the Horizontal
Way, which is on the right Hand, we enter’d
the other on the left, which is six Foot four Inches
wide, and rises also the length of 162 Foot. On
each side the Wall is a Stone-Bench two Foot and
half high, and pretty broad, which serves to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>hold by in going up, to which the Holes that are
made almost every step in the Wall, are of no small
Service, yet are they altogether confus’d and without
order. It is not known by whom they were
made; but those that go to see the <i>Pyramids</i> are
extreamly oblig’d to them however, for without
these Holes it would be impossible to get up, and a
Man must likewise be very strong and in health that
can do so by the help of them, and the Stone-Bench
by which one holds fast with one Hand while the
other holds the Candle; add to this, that a Man
must make large steps, because these Holes are six
Hands breadth distant from each other. This Ascent,
which cannot be conceiv’d without admiration, may
well pass for what is most considerable in the <i>Pyramids</i>;
for the Stones which compose the Walls are
as smooth as Looking-Glass, and so well joyn’d together,
that one would be apt to take them for one
single Stone. The same may be said of the Pavement.
The Roof is here exceeding high and so very
sumptuous, that ’tis better to be represented than
describ’d; I therefore made this Draft of it, while
my Countryman <i>Adrian van Bierbeck</i> rested himself
on the Bench that is on the left Hand, and some of
our Company were already got up with their Lights
into the Chamber where the Tomb or Sepulchre is,
which gave me opportunity to take a view of all
the Roof more at large.’</p>

<p class='c009'>But to return to Mr. <i>Greaves</i>’s Account, he says,
That after having pass’d this Gallery, they enter’d another
square Hole of the same Dimension with the former,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two <i>Anti-Closets</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which brought them into two <i>Anti-Closets</i> lin’d
with a rich and speckl’d sort of <i>Thebaic</i> Marble. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>first of these had almost the same Dimensions as the
second. The second was thus proportion’d: The <i>Area</i>
was level, the Figure of it oblong, the one side containing
seven Foot, the other three and a half, and the
height was of 10 Foot. This inner <i>Anti-Closet</i> was
separated from the former by a Stone of red speckl’d
Marble, which hung in two Mortices (like the Leaf
of a Sluce) between two Walls, more than three Foot
above the Pavement, and wanting only two of the
Roof. Out of this Closet they enter’d another square
Hole of the same wideness and Dimensions with the
rest, and near nine Foot long, all of <i>Thebaic</i> Marble
most exquisitely wrought, which landed them at the
North end of a very sumptuous Room. The distance
from the end of the second Gallery to this Entry is
24 Foot.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A spacious <i>Chamber</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This rich and spacious Chamber, in which
Art may seem to have contended with Nature, the
curious Workmanship being not inferiour to the rich
Materials, lies about the Center of the <i>Pyramid</i>. The
Floor, Roof and Sides of it are all compos’d of vast
Tables of <i>Thebaic</i> Marble, very gracefully siz’d and
plac’d. The nine Stones which cover the Roof are of
a prodigious length, like so many huge Beams traversing
the Room, and supporting the prodigious mass
of the <i>Pyramid</i> above: The length of this Chamber
is about 34 Foot, the breadth 17, the height 19 and
a half.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>wherein stands <i>Cheops</i>’s Tomb.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Within this glorious Room stands the Monument
of <i>Cheops</i> or <i>Chemmis</i>, of one piece of Marble,
hollow within, uncover’d at the top, and sounding
like a Bell, without any Sculpture or Embossment.
But ’tis the common Opinion, after <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>,
that neither <i>Chemmis</i> nor his Successor <i>Cephren</i> were
bury’d in their <i>Pyramids</i>, because, says he, the People
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>being over work’d by them with hard Labour, threatned
to tear their dead Bodies to pieces, and throw
them out of these Sepulchres, therefore they on their
Death-Beds commanded their Servants to bury them
in some obscure Place, <cite>Diod.</cite> Lib. 1. This Monument
is of the same <i>Thebaic</i> Marble with the whole Room,
being speckl’d with black, white and red Spots, and
resembling two Cubes finely set together, and hollow’d
within. ’Tis seven Foot three Inches and half long,
in breadth and depth three Foot three Inches and three
quarters on the out-side, but within ’tis something less,
which shows that the Men of this Age are of the same
Stature with those that liv’d near 3000 Years ago, tho’
some famous Men have thought the contrary. If
any ask how this Monument could be convey’d into
this Chamber, since ’tis impossible for it to enter by
those narrow Passages in the <i>Pyramid</i> which lead to it,
I answer, It must have been rais’d and convey’d up
from without by some Engine, before the Chamber
was finish’d and the Roof clos’d: Thus far <i>Greaves</i>.
<cite>Sandys</cite>, p. 99. says, This <i>Pyramid</i> which is the greatest
of the three,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How many <i>Workmen</i> employ’d in the <i>Building</i> it.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and chief of the Worlds VII Wonders,
employ’d 366000 Workmen continually in building
it for the space of 20 Years, in which Time they consum’d
in Radishes, Garlick and Onions only, 1800
Talents. Nor has Time, which devours the proudest
Structures, humbl’d this lofty Edifice, tho’ ’tis very
probably conjectur’d to have stood 3300 Years, and
is now rather old than ruinous, yet the North side is
most worn by reason of the humidity of the Northern
Winds, which are here the moistest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The second <i>Pyramid</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The second <i>Pyramid</i> is hardly distant the flight of
an Arrow from the first, and is all built of Stones of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>whitish colour, nothing so large as those of the first.
The sides rise not by Degrees or Steps like those of the
former, but are smooth and equal, and the whole
Fabrick seems very entire, except on the South-side.
Tho’ this <i>Pyramid</i> is generally thought to be inferiour
to the first in Magnitude, yet by Mr. <i>Greaves</i>’s Observation,
the height and sides of the Basis are in both
equal. There is no Entrance into it, and therefore
none can tell what Chambers it contains; ’tis bounded
on the North and West by two very stately and
elaborate Structures, being 30 Foot deep, and more
than 1400 long, cut out of the hard Rock, and squar’d
by a Chizzel,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lodgings</i> of the <i>Priests</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which are suppos’d to be the Lodgings
of the Priests. They run along at a convenient distance,
parallel to the two sides of this <i>Pyramid</i>, and
meet in a right Angle. The Entrance into them is
by square Openings, hewn out of the Rock, and much
of the same bigness with those of the first <i>Pyramid</i>.
The hollow space within is somewhat like a square
and well proportion’d Chamber, cover’d and arch’d
above with the natural Rock: In most of these there
was a Passage opening into some other Apartment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The third <i>Pyramid</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The third <i>Pyramid</i> is from the second about a Furlong,
and tho’ it appears at a distance to be of an
equal height with the two former, by reason of the
advantage of its Scituation upon a higher rise of the
Hill, yet is it really much lower, each side of the
Basis being but 300 Foot long, which wants near
400 of the two others. All the antient and modern
Writers generally agree, this <i>Pyramid</i> was made of
black <i>Ethiopic</i> Marble, whereas Mr. <i>Greaves</i> assures
us, on his own Inspection, the whole Mass seems
of a clear and white Stone, somewhat choicer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>brighter than that in either of the two other <i>Pyramids</i>;
but what the Stone within may be no Body
can tell, since there never was any Entrance into it.
At some distance South-East of the biggest <i>Pyramid</i>
stands the <i>Sphinx</i>, so famous among the Ancients:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Sphinx</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
’Tis a Statue or Image cut out of the main Rock, representing
the Head of a Woman with half her
Breast, but is at present sunk or bury’d in the Sand
to the very Neck: It is an extraordinary great Mass,
but withal proportionable, altho’ the Head of it self
be 26 Foot high, and from the Ear to the Chin 15
Foot, according to the Measure the <i>Sieur Thevenot</i>
took of it. At a distance it seems five Stones joyn’d
together, but coming nearer one may discover what
was taken for the Joynings of the Stones, was properly
nothing but the Veins in the Rock. <i>Pliny</i> says,
this serv’d for a Tomb to King <i>Amasis</i>, which is not
improbable, since it is in a Part which was formerly a
kind of Burying-Place, and near the <i>Pyramids</i> and Caves,
which were nothing but Places of Sepulture; and that
according to his Calculation it was 102 Foot in compass
about the Head, 62 high and 143 in length, for
the Body of it is suppos’d to resemble a Lion or Dog.
Some will have it a certain <i>Egyptian</i> King caus’d this
<i>Sphinx</i> to be made in Memory of <i>Rhodope</i> of <i>Corinth</i>,
with whom he was passionately in Love. They say,
among other Things, that when they consulted it at
the rising of the Sun, it answer’d like an Oracle;
yet most believe this was done by the cunning of the
Priests, thro’ means of some hidden Pipes or Conduits
under Ground, and that the Well we describ’d in the
great <i>Pyramid</i> was made use of for the same purpose;
but what makes this appear to be fabulous is, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>there is no perforation or opening either at the Mouth,
Nose, Eyes or Ears. Many other the like Stories
Authors have rais’d of this Statue, affirming that by
the Figure of a <i>Sphinx</i>, was represented the Goddess
<i>Momphta</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>It represented <i>Momphta</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who presided over all the Waters, and chiefly
preserv’d and supply’d the Causes of the Over-flowing
of the River <i>Nile</i>; as also that thereby was signify’d
the State or Condition of that River, for as the Over-flowing
of the <i>Nile</i> continues all the Summer, and
during the Time of Harvest, <i>viz.</i> in the Months of
<i>July</i> and <i>August</i>, and that in those two Months, the
Sun commonly runs thro’ the two Signs of <i>Leo</i> and
<i>Virgo</i>, it was natural enough for the <i>Egyptians</i>, who
had a great inclination for <i>Hieroglyphics</i> and misterious
Representations, to make a Monster of a Virgin
and Lion, which they call’d <i>Sphinx</i>, and consecrated
to the River <i>Nile</i>; the representing of which lying on
its Belly, was to explain the Over-flowing of that
River.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to return again to the <i>Pyramids</i>, near which
this <i>Sphinx</i> stands,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Observations</i> on the <i>Pyramids</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we shall add these few Observations
of Father <i>Vansleb</i> concerning them, <i>viz.</i> That they
are not built with Marble, but with a white sandy
Stone exceeding hard; that none of them are perfectly
square, but have all two sides longer than the others,
which is plainly visible in the greater and the lesser <i>Pyramid</i>:
The North side is longer than that which stretches
from East to West, yet are they nevertheless built in
very good Order, and each of the three largest stand at
the head of 10 lesser, which are not well to be distinguish’d,
by reason of heaps of Sand that lye before them.
They have all an Entrance that leads to a low Alley,
which is exceeding long, and has at the end a Chamber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>where the antient <i>Egyptians</i> plac’d the Bodies of
those Persons for whom the <i>Pyramid</i> was design’d, tho’
this Entrance is not to be seen in every one of them,
because the Wind has stopp’d it up with Sand. On the
top of the largest <i>Pyramid</i> was antiently a Statue or
<i>Colossus</i>: This appears in that it is not so sharp as the
others, but rather plain, and there are yet to be seen
great Holes, which were to keep the <i>Colossus</i> from
falling; but at present there is nothing to be seen at top
but many Letters of the Names of Persons of all Nations,
who had left them to witness they had been
there. Lastly, He makes no question but that this
Place where the <i>Pyramids</i> are built, was the <i>Burying-Place</i>
of the old City of <i>Memphis</i>, by reason all the
<i>Arabian</i> Histories inform us that this City stood where
the <i>Pyramids</i> now are, over against old <i>Cairo</i>. He also
imagines the <i>Sphinx</i> to be a Tomb, <i>First</i>, From its scituation
in a Place which was in former Ages a Burying-Place,
and near the <i>Pyramids</i> and mortuary Caves.
<i>Secondly</i>, That it appears to be a Sepulchre from its
Building; for in the hinder part is a Cave under
Ground, of a bigness answerable to that of the head,
into which he look’d by an Entrance that led into
it, so that it could serve to no other purpose than to
keep a dead Corps.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Caves</i> near the <i>Pyramids</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>From the <i>Pyramids</i>, <i>Vansleb</i> went to take a View of
the <i>Caves</i> that are adjoyning, which formerly serv’d
for Places to bury the Dead in: Of these there are several
hollow’d or cut in the side of a Rock, in bad
Order and without Symmetry on the out-side, but
very even and well proportion’d within: All of them
have a square Well cut likewise out of the Rock, in
which the <i>Egyptians</i> laid the Bodies of those for whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the <i>Cave</i> had been made, it serving them for a Tomb.
The Walls of some of these are full of <i>Hieroglyphic</i>
Figures, cut also in the Rock; in some they are but
small, in others very lively. In one, says he, I counted
16 great Figures, eight Men and as many Women,
holding each other by the Hand, with some other
small Figures on each side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Subterranean Caves.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>But to speak more particularly of the <i>Subterranean
Caves</i>, near the Borough of <i>Sacara</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, we shall
observe, that among the most remarkable Things
that were found, as well in the City of <i>Memphis</i>, as
some Miles round about it, the <i>Caves</i> or Tombs under
Ground were the most considerable, and worthy
the search of the Curious. It is on these <i>Subterranean
Caves</i> that this City and several Places thereabouts were
built, as on so many Vaults, as the Ancients have
written, and those <i>Caves</i> do by far surpass the <i>Catacombs</i>
of <i>Rome</i> both in Grandeur and Beauty; for the
antient <i>Egyptians</i>, who maintain’d the <i>Metempsychosis</i>
or Transmigration of Souls from one Body to another,
took care not only to preserve their Dead from Putrifaction,
but also endeavour’d to lay them up in a secure
and quiet Place of Burial: That they might therefore
take all manner of precaution against any alteration
that might happen to them from the Injuries
of Air, Fire, or the length of Time, they did not place
their Dead in Places where the River <i>Nile</i> might overflow,
nor in the open Fields, but either in <i>Pyramids</i>
of a more durable continuance, or in <i>Subterranean
Vaults</i> built with great care of Stones, or lastly, in
<i>Caves</i> cut out of the Rock it self, for which the Region
of <i>Memphis</i> and Places adjoyning were very proper,
because they consist of a Rock, which is hid under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the thickness of about a Foot and half of Sand.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their <i>Burying-Places</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Their Burying-Places then were <i>Subterranean Caves</i> divided
into several Apartments, roof’d like great Halls,
and with so many Windings, which went from one
to the other, that they resembl’d real <i>Labyrinths</i> or
<i>Meanders</i>. According to the report of the antient
<i>Egyptians</i>, there was such a vast number of those <i>Subterranean
Apartments</i> which butted one against another,
that they extended some Miles in length, even
to the Temple of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, and the Oracle of
<i>Serapis</i>, which was a great conveniency to the Priests,
who might hold a Correspondence with each other
without being scorch’d by the heat of the Sun, or incommoded
by the Sands; so that all those vast sandy
Plains of <i>Egypt</i> were hollow underneath, and divided
into numberless Apartments and Places for dead Corps.
This seems surprizing and almost incredible, but they
that will consider the other prodigious Works of the
<i>Egyptians</i>, and make some Reflections on what the
antient Historians have wrote of the great and most
antient City of <i>Memphis</i>, and the almost infinite number
of that People, will not find this so impossible; besides
what the <i>Arabian</i> Authors say, that there was formerly
a Subterranean Communication between this City
of <i>Memphis</i> and that of <i>Heliopolis</i>, being several Miles
assunder, and which pass’d also under the Bed of the
River <i>Nile</i>. The greatest part of the Inhabitants of
the Borough of <i>Sacara</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How those of <i>Sacara</i> get their <i>Livelyhoods</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which is nearest those <i>Caves</i>
of the <i>Mummies</i> or <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, and three good
Hours Journey from the <i>Pyramids</i>, get their Livelyhoods
by digging into those <i>Caves</i>, and taking out
the <i>Mummies</i>, because their Tillage is not able to
maintain them by reason of the sterrility of the Soil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>wherefore whoever has occasion for their Service, may
easily hire them for Money, to conduct them into <i>Caves</i>
that are already open, to see them, or to dig for new
ones in the Sand, which have not hitherto been remov’d,
for some of these <i>Caves</i> have not yet been discover’d,
being hid in such manner under the Sand,
that there is no Stranger, nor hardly any Inhabitant of
the Country, that can be certain before-hand where
any <i>Mummy</i> may be found: Besides, the <i>Europeans</i>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Entrance</i> into these <i>Caves</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>They enter these <i>Caves</i> by an opening at top even
with the Ground, into which they are let down, as
into a Well, by means of a Rope and the assistance
of a Servant with a Light in their Hands, tho’ in some
few they can climb up and down, by setting their
Feet in certain gaps in the Wall, as appears by the
Plate at <i>p.</i> 203. Letter E. This Well or Descent into
these <i>Caves</i> is about 16 or 18 Foot deep, and at bottom,
the Passage of it is so low, they are forc’d to stoop
and creep thro’, where they arrive in a four-square
Chamber or Repository,

24 Foot every way, on each
side of which, next the Wall, stand Bases or Tables cut
out of the Rock, about five Foot long, two and a half
broad, and one high, whereon are plac’d the dead
Bodies, <i>Embalm’d</i> and adorn’d after the manner before
describ’d, and put into Coffins of Wood or Stone,
carv’d after their own similitude. Many times, besides
the number of Coffins just mention’d, there lye round
about upon the Floor several other little ones, which
seem to be the Coffins of Children. Sometimes there
are abundance of these <i>Caves</i> near each other, as you
may imagine by the Plate before-mention’d; but that
you may have a more clear <i>Idea</i> of all that is here describ’d,
I have added another, the Description of which
is as follows:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Description</i> of the <i>Ichnography</i> and <i>Scenography</i> of these <i>Caves</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

all of an equal bigness, mark’d with the Letters,
B. B. B. Each of these has four Bases whereon the
Coffins are set, as appears by the Figures 1. 2. 3. 4.

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>This may suffice for a general Description of these
<i>Caves</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Observations</i> on the <i>Subterranean Caves</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
yet it may not be amiss to add a few Observations
made by Father <i>Vansleb</i> on this Subject: He tells
us he went on purpose to see these <i>Caves</i>, and gives us
every particular Instance that happen’d to him; but
this we must also take notice of, that <i>Le Bruyn</i> attributes
the very same Remarks to one <i>Milton</i> an <i>English</i>
Man, and he that pleases to give himself the trouble to
read both, will find them much of a piece. They are
as follows: After having said that first an Agreement
must be made with the <i>Arabians</i> of the Borough of <i>Sacara</i>,
about the number and quality of <i>Wells</i> one would
have open’d, as also what was to be given them for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>their Trouble, and that for better security 12 <i>Arabian</i>
Horsemen ought to be brought along with one; he
adds, That the first <i>Well</i> he went to see was that of
<i>Embalm’d</i> Birds,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Wells</i> of <i>Embalm’d Birds</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and that having caus’d the Sand that
cover’d the Mouth of the <i>Well</i> to be remov’d, thro’
which he was to go down, and from thence to enter
into the <i>Cave</i>, he caus’d himself and his Companions
to be let down one after another, by tying a double
Rope about their Middles. So soon as they were at
the bottom, and that every one had lighted his Flambeau,
and several Matches they had brought along
with them, they crept on their Bellies into a <i>Cave</i>,
which was an Entry cut thro’ the Rock about a Man’s
height, a Fathom wide, and extraordinary long. On
each side they found other Entries, cut also into the
Rock, where were several Chambers full of a great
number of Earthen-Pots, with Covers of the same.
In these were contain’d <i>Embalm’d</i> Birds of all kinds,
every Bird having a Pot to it self. They found there
also several Hen-Eggs whole, but which were empty,
and consequently had no ill Smell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having sufficiently view’d this <i>Cave</i>, they were
drawn up again in like manner as they were let down.
Then having commanded their <i>Arabians</i> to open a
<i>Virgin-Well</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A <i>Virgin-Well</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(for so such are call’d as have never been
open’d) they were immediately let down into it, in
the same manner as before describ’d; but being come
to the bottom, they found such a horrid Stench, and so
close an Air, that they were not only not able to breath,
but it also put out their Flambeaus, as likewise their
Matches every time they endeavour’d to light them,
so that they were thereupon forc’d to cause themselves
to be drawn up again with all speed, without having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>been able to advance one step. Our Author says, that
all he could say of this <i>Well</i> was, That it was much
deeper than the former.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A <i>Cave</i> with two <i>Mummies</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>After this he caus’d another <i>Cave</i> to be open’d, which
was not a <i>Virgin-Well</i> as the former. Being let down into
it he found there two <i>Mummies</i>, one greater and
the other lesser of a Child, both in Coffins: The biggest
was of Marble, cut after the likeness of him for whom
it was made. He caus’d them to be open’d but found
nothing extraordinary in them, therefore took no Account
of them, but left them where he found them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A <i>Cave</i> call’d the <i>Church</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>He went down next into a <i>Cave</i> call’d the <i>Church</i>,
which, he says, was the shallowest of all he had seen, it
being nothing but a long Entry under Ground, well
Plaister’d and Painted every-where with <i>Hierogliphics</i>.
He tells us there was so great a quantity of Sand in
this <i>Cave</i>, that he and his Company were forc’d to
creep along on their Knees; for as soon as any one
has seen these <i>Wells</i>, the <i>Arabians</i> are wont to fill them
up again with Sand, if the Wind does not do it for
them, that they may get more Money by them another
Time; for this is the greatest Livelihood these
miserable Creatures have, and the least they take for
opening a <i>Virgin-Well</i> is 30 <a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a><i>Piasters</i>. The reason of
this high Price is, that those which cause them to be
open’d, have the liberty to carry away all the Curiosities
and <i>Mummies</i> they find there.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Each <i>Piaster</i> is 5 <i>s.</i> Sterling or thereabouts, so the whole may make near 9 <i>l.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now to give a perfect <i>Idea</i> of this Plain of <i>Mummies</i>,
the antient Burying-Place of the <i>Egyptians</i>, you
must represent to your self a vast and boundless Champion
Country, cover’d all over with Sand, where there
are neither Trees, Plants, Grass, Houses, nor any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>like them to be seen, but the whole Surface is strew’d
with dry Bones of Arms, Legs, Feet, Heads, old Linnen
Rags, broken Tombs or Coffins, and a great many
little Idols, some of Wood, and others of Earth glaz’d
with a green colour, and mark’d before and behind
with <i>Hieroglyphics</i>: In some places you may see great
Tomb-Stones, engrav’d with Cyphers and Ænigmatical
Figures, that represent something of Chymistry
and other Sciences and Mysteries of the antient <i>Egyptians</i>,
as also some strange Characters that are no
<i>Hieroglyphics</i>. These are the remains of their Pride
and Vanity, as likewise sad Proofs that all Men are
subject to Death: This causes Horrour to those that
come first into the Plain, and if one considers attentively
the number of Bones wherewith it is strew’d,
one would be apt to think that Place had formerly
been a Field of Battel. So much for the <i>Pyramids</i> and
<i>Subterranean Caves</i>, now there only remains to speak
of the <i>Sepulchral Lamps</i>, which some assert to have burnt
perpetually, and have therefore been the Subject of
much Discourse among the <i>Virtuosi</i> of all Ages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Authors</i> who have written of <i>Sepulchral Lamps</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, <i>Appian</i>, <i>Burattinus</i>, <i>Hermolaus
Barbarus</i>, <i>Costæus</i>, <i>Citesius</i>, <i>Cælius</i>, <i>Casalius</i>, <i>Cedrenus</i>,
<i>Delrius</i>, <i>Ericius</i>, <i>Foxius</i>, <i>Gesnerus</i>, <i>Jacobonus</i>, <i>Leander</i>, <i>Libavius</i>,
<i>Lazius</i>, <i>Langius</i>, <i>Licetus</i>, <i>Maiolus</i>, <i>Maturantius</i>,
<i>Baptista Porta</i>, <i>Pancirollus</i>, <i>Ruscellius</i>, <i>Scardeonius</i>, <i>Tassonius</i>,
<i>Ludovicus Vives</i>, <i>Volateranus</i> and many other
learned and ingenious Authors, who have written of
these <i>Sepulchral Lamps</i>, do most of them believe and
strenuously assert, that they burn’d for several Hundreds
of Years, and would have so continu’d, perhaps for
ever, had they not been broken by the unadvis’d Irruptions
of Rustics and Husbandmen, by diging up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the Ground, or otherwise extinguish’d by the like Accidents.
’Tis true, there are not many that affirm that
they themselves saw any of these <i>Lamps</i> burning, but
then they give you abundance of Instances of such as
did, and where they were found, which being too
many to be inserted here, we shall only mention a few,
after having inquir’d to what End and Purpose they
were invented and made use of; of what Matter and
Fashion they were compos’d, and whether it were
possible for any of them, when once lighted, to burn
perpetually without any addition or supply of fresh
Aliment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perpetual Lamps</i> to what end invented.</div>

<p class='c009'>First then we are to understand, that as the <i>Egyptians</i>
(thro’ a firm belief they had of the <i>Metempsychosis</i>)
affected to procure a Perennity to the Body by <i>Balsamation</i>
or <i>Embalming</i>, and the security thereof by
<i>Pyramids</i>, <i>Subterranean Vaults</i>, &amp;c. so they endeavour’d
to animate the Defunct by perpetual Fire, which answer’d
the Nature of their Souls:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Fire</i> an <i>Emblem</i> of the <i>Soul</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For with them Fire
was the <i>Symbol</i> of an Incorruptible, Immortal and
Divine Nature, and hence some will have it, they erected
<i>Pyramids</i> (<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>the <i>Symbols</i> of Fire) of that Solidity as
easily to overcome the Injuries of Time, and by their
Figure to demonstrate the Immortality of the Soul.
And whereas flaming Fire was more corruscating and
enlightning than any other Matter, they invented
<i>Lamps</i> to hang in the Sepulchres of the Rich, which
would burn perpetually without any assistance or addition.
This as it was a <i>Symbol</i> of the Immortality
of the Soul, so did it likewise serve for a <i>Symbol</i> of
their grateful Intentions towards the <i>Manes</i> and Guardian
Gods, who protected the Bodies in their Sepulchres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>thereby both venerating, honouring and respecting
the Souls of the Deceas’d, and also rendring what
was very grateful and acceptable to them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>And of <i>Eternal
Life</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now
whereas the <i>Egyptians</i> signify’d Life by a <i>Lamp</i>, and
also believ’d that their Immortal Souls tarry’d in the
Grave with their Bodies, so after having <i>Embalm’d</i>
those Bodies to prevent the Souls forsaking them, by
reason of their Corruption and Dissolution, they deposited
them in <i>Subterranean Caves</i>, where they had
provided <i>Lamps</i> that would burn perpetually, to the
end that their Souls might not lye miserably imprison’d
in darkness, and thereby any hurt befal them; but on
the contrary, enjoy eternal light and be free from all
evil, or that when the Soul should wander, it might
not mistake its Residence, but be by the light of the
<i>Lamp</i> guided and conducted to return to its former
Habitation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>These are the absur’d Opinions of the Superstitious
<i>Egyptians</i>, and the Reasons why they plac’d burning
<i>Lamps</i> with the Dead in their <i>Subterranean Vaults</i>, as
<i>Jacobonus</i>, <i>Foxius</i>, <i>Scaliger</i> and others relate; therefore
the next Thing which we shall consider, is, whether
there ever was or can be such a Thing made as a
perpetual burning <i>Lamp</i>. Most of the before-mention’d
Authors believe there were such <i>Lamps</i>: <i>Licetus</i>
particularly has writ a whole <i>Folio</i> to prove it, and
<i>Kircher</i> produces a Story out of <i>Schiangia</i>, an <i>Arabian</i>
Author, which he thinks will solve it; but however,
whether there have been any perpetual burning <i>Lamps</i>
or not, since no Author of good Credit ever saw one,
it is nevertheless very certain that <i>Lamps</i> are frequently
found in the Sepulchres and <i>Subterranean Caves</i> of the
Dead, which, to what end and purpose they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>there plac’d, will still remain a great <i>Quere</i>, unless it
were for the above-alledg’d Reasons, since <i>Licetus</i> and
other Authors say, These were the proper Places for
them, asserting they might be extinguish’d by the admission
of Air in the breaking up of such Places.
<i>Greaves</i> at the end of his Description of the first <cite>Pyramid</cite>,
p. 99. takes notice of two Inlets or Spaces in the
<i>South</i> and <i>North</i> side of the Chamber, just opposite to
one another, very evenly cut and running in a straight
Line about six Foot into the thickness of the Wall,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamps</i> suppos’d to have been in the first <i>Pyramid</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which, he says, by the blackness within, seem to have
been a Receptacle for the burning of <i>Lamps</i>. <i>T. Livius
Burattinus</i> would gladly have believ’d it had been
an Hearth for one of these perpetual <i>Lamps</i> which we
now are speaking of; but <i>Greaves</i> imagines the Invention
not to be so antient as this <i>Pyramid</i>: However,
<i>Burattinus</i> in his <i>Italian</i>, and <i>Michael Schatta</i> in his
<i>Arabic</i> Letter to <i>Kircher</i>, which you may read in <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oedipi
Ægyptiaci Theatrum Hierogliphicum</span></cite>, p. 544. affirm that
they found many <i>Lamps</i> in the <i>Subterranean Caves</i> of
old <i>Memphis</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamps</i> in the <i>Subterranean Caves</i> of <i>Memphis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
some having three, four, eight or 12
Lights, and made in the shape of Dog, Man, Bull, Hawk,
Serpent and the like. Also <i>Casalius</i> tells us he had
some <i>Lamps</i> of Brass which represented a Dog, Ox,
Sphinx, <i>&amp;c.</i> and some made of Earth. Seeing therefore
they are so different in their matter, shape and
number of Lights, I have given you the Sculptures of
15 of them, with their Description more at large.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A <i>Description</i> of some <i>Lamps</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The first Figure represents <i>Serapis</i> sitting in a Chair,
having a Basket made of Rushes on his Head; he rests
his right Hand on a Staff or Scepter, and lays his left
on a tripple-headed Monster, such a one as is joyn’d
to the Statue of <i>Serapis</i> at <i>Alexandria</i>:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and first of <i>Serapis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This <i>Lamp</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>was found between the Walls, near one of the Gates
of <i>Rome</i> call’d <i>Capena</i>, and is in the Custody of <i>Pietro
Santo Bartoli</i>, as <i>Bellori</i> informs us, from whom we
have taken the three first and the sixth Figures.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of a tripple-headed <i>Monster</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
second Figure shews the tripple-headed monstrous Representation
of <i>Serapis</i> at <i>Alexandria</i>: It is an Image
of Brass with the Heads of three several kinds of Animals,
<i>viz.</i> In the middle the Head of a Lion, on the
right Hand that of a fawning Dog, and on the left
that of a rapacious Wolf, which signifie the three
Times, the present, past and to come. The Body is
environ’d with two Serpents in four Wreaths or Circumvolutions
from the Legs to the Neck, perhaps to
denote the four Seasons, turn’d about by the Sun;
for by the Figure of <i>Serapis</i> the <i>Egyptians</i> denoted the
Sun: See a fuller Description of it in <i>Macrobii Saturnalibus</i>.
This is kept at present in the Royal Collection
of the King of <i>Prussia</i>, together with the whole
<i>Musæum</i> of <i>Bellori</i>, which that Prince purchas’d.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Another <i>Lamp</i> of <i>Serapis</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
third Figure is the Head of <i>Serapis</i>, with a Basket and
Crown upon it like the Rays of the Sun: These express
the Nature of that God, whom the <i>Egyptians</i> believ’d
to be the same with the Sun, <i>viz.</i> The Beginning and
Ending of all such Things as proceed from and return
back to it. The Basket on the top of the Head
shows, says <i>Macrobius</i>, the height of this Planet and
the virtue of its Influence, in that all earthly Things
return to it, whilst they are drawn up by the Heat
it immits; for which Reason this God is thought to
be the same with <i>Pluto</i>, and was not rarely added to
the <i>Sepulchral Lamps</i>, as these two testifie; the latter
of which, being of excellent Workmanship, is in the
Custody of <i>Raphael Fabrettus</i>. Before we proceed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>give any farther Description of these <i>Lamps</i>, it may
be necessary to remark, that some were also kept in
the <i>Egyptian</i> Temples and other Places, as well as in
the <i>Caves</i> of the Dead; but then, says <i>Kircher</i>, they
were made in the similitude of that God who was
worshipp’d in that Temple. Thus in the Temple of
<i>Anubis</i>, the <i>Lamp</i> was in the likeness of a Dog’s Head,
or else in the shape of his whole Body; in the Temple
of <i>Osiris</i> it was in the form of a Hawk’s Head, or of
the whole Bird; in the Temple of <i>Isis</i>, of a Half Moon,
and so of the rest. The <i>Lamps</i> were wrought in the
same fashion with those <i>Numina</i> represented in each
particular Temple or Place, as all those testifie which
have been brought from <i>Egypt</i>, and are at this Day
kept in the Cabinets of the Curious. Moreover you
must observe that the <i>Egyptians</i> set up <i>Lamps</i> not only
to those Gods that were beneficial to them, but likewise
to such as were mischievous, to the end they
might more readily have recourse to the one and
avoid the other. Of this last kind <i>Johannes Nardius</i>
sent one out of his <i>Musæum</i> to <i>Kircher</i>, in the form
and shape as is express’d by Figure the fourth, <i>viz.</i>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A <i>Lamp</i> of <i>Typhon</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Under the <i>Symbol</i> of an Ass, <i>Typhon</i> was represented,
because, as <i>Plutarch</i> observes, his Voice was like the
braying of that Animal, and which he likewise resembl’d
in colour, ignorance and stupidity. This <i>Typhon</i>
was thought to bring Sterility, Droughts, Contagion,
and the like kind of Evils upon the <i>Egyptians</i>,
therefore to prevent his obstructing the fruitful overflowing
of the <i>Nile</i>, they form’d his <i>Lamps</i> in the
manner you see, that knowing himself by his Image,
he might cease from perpetrating of Evil: <i>Silenus</i>
likewise, who is the <i>Symbol</i> of the <i>Nile</i>’s Fertility, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>constant Attendant on <i>Bacchus</i> or <i>Osiris</i>, rides astride
on his Head, and thereby restrains his power of doing
Mischief: This <i>Lamp</i> moreover stands on the Foot of
an Eagle or Hawk, thereby, says <i>Kircher</i>, to represent
how <i>Typhon</i>’s destructive and flagrating Power lying
hid in the Sun, was made more temperate by a Humour
which <i>Silenus</i>, the Page of the aforesaid <i>Bacchus</i>,
had the Command of; for, as <i>Plutarch</i> well observes,
<i>Isis</i> would never have <i>Typhon</i> quite destroy’d, but only
conquer’d, because tho’ his adust and fiery Nature, by
reason of its too great Siccity, was pernicious, nevertheless
being temper’d with much moisture, it was sometimes
useful. The fifth Figure represents a <i>Lamp</i>, whose
bigger <i>Foramen</i> on the middle of its Superficies, where
they pour’d in the Oil, is cover’d with a large <i>Heliotrope</i>
inverted,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A <i>Lamp</i> of a <i>Heliotrope</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a Flower so call’d by the <i>Greeks</i> from
its ever inclining towards the Course of the Sun; for
in the Morning it turns to the <i>East</i>, at Noon is erect,
towards the Evening faces the <i>West</i>, and at Night inclines
to the Earth, enquiring, as it were, for the Sun
bury’d under Ground, and waiting for its Resurrection
the next Morning. This may serve to teach us
what Affinity, Temper and Agreement Things of an
inferior Nature have with those that are Celestial;
and if <i>Aristotle</i> confesses that the Winds, Waters and
other inanimate Things follow the heavenly Circuit,
why should we question the <i>Heliotrope</i>’s subsequency
to the Course of the Sun, or the <i>Seliotrope</i>’s to that
of the Moon? Surely he who form’d this Flower
turn’d downwards on a <i>Sepulchral Lamp</i>, seems thereby
to intimate the Night of Death which Bodies suffer
under Ground, and withal to show, according to
the Opinion of the Ancients, that the Souls of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Deceas’d tarry together with their Bodies in the Grave.
This <i>Lamp</i>, as likewise those at Figure the 7th, 10th,
12th, 13th and 15th were first publish’d by <i>Casalius</i>,
and explain’d by <i>Licetus</i>. The next <i>Lamp</i>, mark’d
with Figure six,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of the <i>Alexandrian Pharos</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
seems to represent the <i>Pharos</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>,
into whose Haven a Ship is just entring, the
Seamen being furling up their Sails, and for want of
a better Reason, is suppos’d to have been plac’d in the
Sepulchre of a certain Merchant of that City; but is
now in the <i>Musæum</i> of <i>Pietro Santo Bartoli</i>, as <i>Bellori</i>
informs us. As concerning the following <i>Lamp</i>, with
a big Belly and Handle, and standing upon three Feet,
as you may see at Figure the seventh, <i>Licetus</i> believes
<i>Casalius</i> is under a mistake in reckoning it for a <i>Lamp</i>,
and that it was rather a certain Vessel in form of a
Cucumber, in which the Ancients were wont to heat
Water; but I cannot be of his Opinion, since by its
shape it looks very much unlike a Cucumber, and from
the smallness of its Mouth at top, and the appearance
of a Place for the Wiek, it seems most probably to
have been a <i>Lamp</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <i>Lamp</i> of an <i>Ox</i> with a <i>Boy</i> on his Back.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The eighth <i>Lamp</i>, made in the
shape of an Ox couching on the Ground, with a Boy
sitting on his Back, and holding a Fig-Leaf in his
Hand, was sent by the Great Duke of <i>Tuscany</i> out of
his <i>Musæum</i>, to <i>Kircher</i>: The Ox being the Figure of
<i>Apis</i>, and <i>Apis</i> signifying the chief <i>Numen</i> or Patron
of Agriculture, wherefore this <i>Lamp</i> was plac’d in the
Temple of <i>Apis</i> in Honour of that God, denoting by
the Vessel, the pious and religious Affection the antient
<i>Egyptians</i> had for that Deity; and by the Fire the
vital Heat, thinking that if he were absent from their
Husbandry, all would run to the last Destruction.
Under that <i>Symbol</i> therefore they tacitely sollicited this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span><i>Numen</i> to grant warmth and vital Heat to the Fields
and Meadows, hoping, by the religious Ceremony of
Fire, that he would be more vigilant and take greater
care of Things committed to his Trust. By the Boy
and Fig-Leaf they denoted the vital Heat and vegetable
Life communicated to this Deity, whereby all Things
are fructify’d, and seem as it were to grow young
again. The ninth Figure or <i>Lamp</i> represents a very
fair and entire <i>Sphinx</i> with a Womans Face,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of a <i>Sphinx</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
having
her Head bound about with a Fillet or Hair-Lace,
the hinder part cover’d with a Coif, and two
Horns rising out of her Forehead; the Body and Legs
were like a Lion’s, and on the top of the Back was a
great <i>Foramen</i>, thro’ which they pour’d the Oil: The
Breast was very protuberant and somewhat like a Scollop-Shell,
at the top of which is seen a lesser <i>Foramen</i>
for the Wick. This <i>Kircher</i> positively believes to have
been a <i>Sepulchral Lamp</i>, forasmuch as the antient <i>Egyptians</i>
were wont to place <i>Sphinx</i>’s about their <i>Sepulchres</i>,
and <i>Pliny</i> moreover witnesses, that an entire
<i>Pyramid</i> was built in <i>Egypt</i> of that shape, whom you
may consult more at large, <i>Lib.</i> 36. <i>cap.</i> 12. The
tenth <i>Lamp</i> has two Wieks,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of the <i>Moon</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and may either be hung
up or set upon its Foot: From the form of a Crescent
at the other extremity or handle, it is thought to have
been dedicated to the Moon, or else to have burn’d
in the Sepulchre of some Person of Rank, as a <i>Symbol</i>
of his Nobility, of which this was an <i>Hieroglyphic</i>,
and therefore they antiently wore one in their Shoes,
<i>&amp;c.</i> to distinguish them from inferior Persons, and
perhaps might also Sup by a <i>Lamp</i> made in that form
in token of their Quality and Grandure. As this had
two, so the following <i>Lamp</i> at Figure eleven had four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Wieks or Lights,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> with four <i>Lights</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
being, as <i>Nardius</i> tells us, brought
out of <i>Egypt</i>, with some <i>Mummies</i>, to the Grand Duke
of <i>Tuscany</i>, by which, says <i>Kircher</i>, nothing seems
more to be meant than the Worship of those Deities
which went before the four Seasons of the Year; for
seeing the Prosperity of the whole Republic depended
on the Plenty of those Things, to which the abovesaid
Deities were distributed, in the Circle of the four
Seasons of the Year, they aptly apply’d the <i>Lamp</i> with
four Lights to complete these mysterious Ceremonies;
for the <i>Egyptians</i> erected their <i>Lamps</i> with so many
Lights as the number of that Deity, consecrated to any
one, contain’d of Unities.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> with an <i>Ox’s</i> Head.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The <i>Lamp</i> at Figure the
twelfth, with the Head of an Ox, which as <i>Valerianus</i>,
Lib. 3. <cite>Hierogl.</cite> plainly demonstrates to be the <i>Symbol</i>
of the Earth, was Sepulchral and depicted Hieroglyphically,
to show that the Body of Man was resolv’d
into Earth from whence it was first form’d.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of a wing’d <i>Sphinx</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Figure the
thirteenth is a <i>Lamp</i> on whose Superficies a wing’d <i>Sphinx</i>
grav’d or wrought, which as it was among the <i>Egyptians</i>
the <i>Symbol</i> of secret Wisdom, so it denotes that
this <i>Lamp</i> was plac’d in the Sepulchre of some Learned
Man, whose Sayings were wont to be Ænigmatical,
and were represented by the Image of a <i>Sphinx</i>; or
perhaps more particularly to denote the <i>Depositum</i> of
some Noble Poet; for it is the property of a Poet,
under the cover of a Fable, to contain the mysterious
Secrets of Divine Matters, and to enlighten the hidden
Senses of honest Actions, that they may be imitated.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> with two beaked <i>Ships</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The next <i>Lamp</i> at Figure the fourtenth was
purchas’d of the <i>Arabians</i>, by that excellent Physician
<i>John Baptista Bonagente Vicentinus</i>, who saw them take
it out of one of the Caves of the Mummies near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span><i>Pyramids</i>, and after his Death <i>Fr. Sanctus a Plebe Sacci</i>
bought it out of his Collection at <i>Cairo</i>, and brought it
to <i>Padua</i>, where he presented it to the most illustrious
<i>Sertorio Ursatto</i>, who afterwards show’d it to <i>Licetus</i>,
and he gave the following Figure and Description of it,
<i>viz.</i> That it had twelve Lights or Wieks, and on it
was represented two beaked Ships with many Oars, as
it were mutually going into a hostile Engagement,
which denotes, says <i>Licetus</i>, that this <i>Lamp</i> was plac’d
in the Sepulchre either of a certain famous Pirate,
Commander of 12 Gallies, with three Oars on a side,
and who infested the <i>Egyptian</i> Seas, or, on the contrary,
of some Captain who defended their Coasts from their
Enemies; to which he adds, that this <i>Lamp</i> being but
small, and having 12 large Wieks, it must undeniably
have consumed away in a very short Time, unless it
were fill’d with incombustible Oil.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> with a <i>Dog</i>’s Head.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By the fifteenth
and last Figure of a <i>Lamp</i>, on the extremity of whose
handle is a Dog’s Head, <i>Pierius</i> and <i>Ambrosius</i> think is
signify’d, that Men are faithfully to keep their Words
and Trust in all Things committed to their Charge;
and that a Dog’s Head had a chief Place in Sepulchral
<i>Lamps</i>, inasmuch as it was the Hieroglyphic of a Sexton
or <i>Libitinarius</i>; for as a Dog by firm and stedfast
looking on, watches and defends the Images both of
Gods and Men, so the <i>Libitinarii</i> were to keep and
look to the <i>Embalm’d</i> Bodies, and all Things appertaining
thereunto or Funeral Ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus <i>Licetus</i>, <i>Bellori</i> and <i>Kircher</i> have given you
their Opinions of the Hieroglyphical Signatures and
Significations of some <i>Egyptian Lamps</i>, which we
have just now mention’d, to which we will add two
more very well worth the taking notice of, the one a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>particular Ceremony of burning sweet-smelling <i>Lamps</i>
and <i>Incense</i> to the deceas’d Daughter of King <i>Mycerinus</i>,
and the other a general lighting of <i>Lamps</i>
throughout all <i>Egypt</i>, call’d <i>The Feast of Lamps</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lamp</i> of <i>Mycerinus</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The first was instituted by <i>Mycerinus</i>, one of the
Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, who, being depriv’d of Heirs, by the
Death of his Daughter and only Child, endeavour’d
to immortalize her Memory by the most sumptuous
Structure he could devise: For this end instead
of a Subterranean Cave or Sepulchre, he erected
a very fine Palace, with a Hall in the midst of it, beautifully
adorn’d with abundance of Statues and Figures.
In this Hall he deposited her Corps in a Coffin made
after the similitude of an Ox in a kneeling posture,
and cover’d over with Plates of Gold and a Purple-Mantle:
The Ox had between its Horns a Sun of
massy Gold, and before it there burn’d a <i>Lamp</i>, whose
Flames were fed with most odoriferous Oils. Round
about the Hall stood Perfuming-Pans and Censers,
which continually threw up Clouds of sweet-smelling
Odours; but this being more fully describ’d before,
<i>p.</i> 200. we will refer you thither for a more particular
Account, where it is also lively represented by a Plate
or Figure.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Feast</i> of <i>Lamps</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The second, <i>viz.</i> The <i>Feast of Lamps</i>, is describ’d by
several Authors, tho’ they differ in their Opinions concerning
its Origin; some will have it that the <i>Egyptians</i>
celebrated this Feast on certain Days of the
Year, that <i>Osiris</i>, or the Sun, might not be wanting
to preserve them by his Plenty and Benevolence, therefore
they made a Sacrifice of <i>Lamps</i>, or a general Illumination
to him throughout all <i>Egypt</i>, by reason they
thought Fire the best <i>Symbol</i> or representation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Sun, whom they worshipp’d and call’d <i>Osiris</i>, but
whom the <i>Greeks</i> term’d <i>Pluto</i> or <i>Vulcan</i>, which last
some think the first Inventor or God of Fire. Moreover,
<i>Macrobius</i> says, <i>Osiris</i> was nothing else but the
Sun, and <i>Isis</i> the Earth and Nature, made fruitful by
him, and Mother of all Productions, which are form’d
in her Bosom. Others say <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i> were King
and Queen of <i>Egypt</i>, who reign’d with extraordinary
mildness, conferring many great Benefits on their
Subjects; also that they hindred Men from eating one
another as they were formerly wont to do, and taught
them Agriculture and the Use of Corn and Wine; moreover
that they made excellent Laws, wherefore <i>Plutarch</i>
says, from their being such good <i>Genii</i>, they became
Gods, as a just Reward to their Virtue, and that
<i>Osiris</i> was <i>Pluto</i> and <i>Isis</i> <i>Proserpina</i>. <cite>Herodotus</cite> in his
<i>Euterpe</i> speaks thus of the <i>Feast of Lamps</i>, having told
us in another place, as <i>Casalius</i> observes, that the <i>Egyptians</i>
were more religious than all others in the care
of their <i>Lamps</i>. ‘But when they had assembl’d together
at <i>Sais</i>, the City of Sacrifice, they took their
<i>Lamps</i>, prepar’d with good Wieks, fill’d with Oil, and
season’d with Salt, and in the Evening lighted them
in the open Air before their Houses, burning them
all the Night, whence this lighting of <i>Lamps</i> came
to be call’d a <i>Feast of Lamps</i>. Now tho’ all the <i>Egyptians</i>
might not come to this Convention, yet did
they all observe the Night of Sacrifice, and all lighted
their <i>Lamps</i>, so that they were not only lighted
in <i>Sais</i>, but also throughout all <i>Egypt</i>; but for what
cause this Night obtain’d so much Glory and Honour,
a certain holy Reason is given;’ yet which <cite>Herodotus</cite>
does not declare.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>To what end the <i>Feast of Lamps</i> was instituted.</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Some think the <i>Egyptians</i> were wont to light up
these <i>Lamps</i> in the Night, to find <i>Osiris</i> out with <i>Isis</i>,
he being kill’d, as they say, by his Brother <i>Typhon</i>.
Moreover, <i>Lactantius</i> tells us, the Priests beat their
Breasts, and lamented with great Howlings, just as
<i>Isis</i> did when she had lost <i>Osiris</i>, but rejoyc’d again
when they had found him, so that from this often
loosing and finding him, <i>Lucan</i> thus expresses himself
on that Subject:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunquamq; satis quæsitus Osiris.</span></i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Also by observing this Worship or Celebration of the
<i>Feast of Lamps</i>, they promis’d themselves great Plenty
of all Things; for as <i>Pausanias</i> relates, the <i>Nile</i>’s beginning
to encrease in those Days that they celebrated
this Feast to <i>Isis</i>, in bewailing <i>Osiris</i>, induc’d them to
believe, that the increase of that River, and Inundation
of the Fields, was occasion’d only by the Tears
which <i>Isis</i> shed for the Death of <i>Osiris</i>, and some will
have <i>Osiris</i> to be the <i>Nile</i>, and <i>Isis</i> <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The true and sacred <i>Reason</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>But the true and Sacred Reason why the <i>Egyptians</i>
celebrated this Feast of <i>Lamps</i> with Tears and Lamentations,
<i>Casalius</i> thinks to have been in Memory of
that doleful Night, in which <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> slew all the First-Born
of <i>Egypt</i>, as well Men as Beasts (among whom
was <i>Osiris</i>) to the end that he might bring the Children
of <i>Israel</i> out of that Country; for then King
<i>Pharaoh</i> and all the <i>Egyptians</i> rose out of their Beds
in the midst of the Night, and lighting their <i>Lamps</i>,
lamented their slain Sons, thereby suffering the Sons
of <i>Israel</i> to go free out of the Land, as appears by
<i>Exodus</i> the 12th Chapter and the 12th, 29th, 30th, 31st,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>32d and 33d Verses, where it is thus written: <i>I the
Lord will pass thro’ the Land of</i> Egypt <i>this Night,
and will smite all the First-Born, both Man and Beast;
and against all the Gods of</i> Egypt <i>will I execute
Judgment. And it came to pass that at Midnight the
Lord smote all the First-Born of</i> Pharaoh, <i>that sat on
his Throne, unto the First-Born of the Captive that was
in the Dungeon, and all the First-Born of Cattle. And</i>
Pharaoh <i>rose up in the Night, he and all his Servants,
and all the</i> Egyptians, <i>and there was a great Cry in
all</i> Egypt; <i>for there was not a House where there was
not one dead. And he call’d for</i> Moses <i>and</i> Aaron <i>by
Night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from amongst
my People, both you and the Children of</i> Israel, <i>and go,
serve the Lord, as ye have said. Also take your Flocks
and your Herds, as ye have said; and be gone, and
bless me also. And the</i> Egyptians <i>were urgent upon the
People, that they might send them out of the Land in
haste; for they said, we be all dead Men</i>. So that
this true History of the Nightly Bewailings of the
<i>Egyptians</i>, every one over his First-Born that was
dead, and of their Joy by reason of their being freed
from the fear of the Death of their other Children,
at <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em>’s People going out of their Land, was
the true occasion why the <i>Egyptians</i> did afterwards
celebrate it with the <i>Feast of Lamps</i>, describ’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite>,
and which the <i>Egyptian</i> Priests, who conceal’d
all their Mysteries under <i>Hieroglyphics</i> like to Fables,
did to shew the wonderful and miserable Bewailings of
<i>Isis</i> for slain <i>Osiris</i>, who some think was the First-Born
of <i>Pharaoh</i>. On the contrary, so soon as this Night
was over, the <i>Egyptians</i> worshipp’d the Rising Sun,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>with rejoycings and leaping about, and a great number
of both Sexes, says <i>Apuleius</i>, appeas’d the Celestial Bodies
with <i>Lamps</i>, <i>Torches</i> and other kind of Lights;
but the Chief Priest carry’d a very famous burning
<i>Lamp</i>, not like those commonly us’d at Evening-Banquets,
but like to a Golden Boat, out of the middle
of which issu’d forth a very large and bright Flame.
But neither of these <i>Lamps</i> describ’d by <cite>Herodotus</cite>, to
wit, that of <i>Mycerinus</i>, or those us’d at the <i>Feast of
Lamps</i>, are said to have burn’d perpetually, without
ever going out, or any addition of new Matter being
made to them: Nevertheless, some affirm, there have
been such <i>Lamps</i> as endur’d for many Ages, and probably
might have been perpetual, had they not been
accidentally broken or extinguish’d:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of <i>Tulliola</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of these, the most
remarkable is that which <i>Erasmus Franciscus</i> produces
out of <i>Pflaumerus</i>, <i>Pancirollus</i> and others, <i>viz.</i> That
under the Reign of Pope <i>Paul</i> III. in the <i>Appian</i> Way
to <i>Rome</i>, where many of the chief Heathens were formerly
bury’d, a Tomb was open’d in which there
was found the entire Body of a very fair Lady,
swimming in a wonderful Liquor which preserv’d it
from Putrifaction in such manner, that the Face was
no ways sunk, but seem’d exceeding beautiful and like
to the Life it self: Her Hair was yellow, wreath’d
about with an artificial Ligature, and connected with
a Circle or Gold-Ring. Under her Feet burn’d a
<i>Lamp</i>, whose Flame vanish’d upon opening the Sepulchre;
from some grav’d Marks it appear’d the
Body had been there bury’d above 1500 Years, but
whose it was is not yet known, tho’ many have suppos’d
it to have been the Body of <i>Tulliola</i>, Daughter
of <i>Cicero</i>, from this short Inscription said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>been found grav’d on the Tomb, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">TULLIOLÆ FILIÆ MEÆ.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Some say this Body, so soon as it was touch’d, immediately
turn’d to Ashes and disappear’d; but the truth
of this Story is very much to be question’d,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Refuted.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and if we
enquire strictly into each particular Circumstance, it
will appear altogether fabulous: For, <i>First</i>, if it had
been kept with any Balsamic Liquor, it could not so
soon have turn’d to Ashes, and if it had not been <i>Embalm’d</i>,
then for it to have been kept uncorrupt so
many Hundreds of Years, would have been as great
a Miracle as the burning of the <i>Lamp</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, The
Argument from the Inscription, that it was the Body
of <i>Tulliola</i>, is as doubtful as the matter of Fact can be
true, for any one never so indifferently vers’d in the
Monuments of the Antients, will believe it ought then
to have been written in this manner, and according
to their usual Custom: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. Tullius Cicero, Terentiæ
Uxori, Tulliolæ Filiæ</span></i>, &amp;c. if either the Father had
been bury’d there, or had built it for his Wife and
Children: Also the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meæ</span></i> is needless, forasmuch
as she was the Daughter, not of another but of the
Person that built the Tomb for himself and Family;
but who it was that either built the Tomb, or was
Father to the Daughter, the words of the Inscription
do not show, whereby they appear in all respects to
be, not the Truth and Elegancy of those Times, but
meer Novelties and Follies: Besides, it could not be any
of <i>Cicero</i>’s Family (and therefore the Assertion and Title
must be false) because in his Time and long before,
the <i>Romans</i> were wont to burn all Bodies, and thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>reduce them to Ashes, except those of Infants that
had not had their Teeth cut, and a few particular Families;
but of this number we do not read that <i>Cicero</i>
was one who was exempted from the Flames of the
Funeral Pyre. Some therefore who deservedly suspect
the Title, will have it to be the Body of <i>Priscilla</i>,
Daughter of <i>Abascantus</i>; but whoever it was, <i>Judæus
Apella</i> thinks it not to have been reduc’d to Ashes by
burning, but by the immission of the Air or contact
of the Body, and that it had without <i>Embalming</i>, remain’d
incorrupt 1500 Years, whereas both Iron and
Marble are consum’d in much lesser Time. But <i>Cælius
Rhodiginus</i>, <cite>Antiq. Lect.</cite> Lib. 3. cap. 24. relates it quite
otherwise, <i>viz.</i> That it suffer’d not the Injuries of
Time, by reason of its being condited with Aromatics,
until three Days after it was brought into the City,
when the Medicament being remov’d or vitiated it putrify’d.
<i>Lastly</i>, This Author as well as <i>Aresius</i>, <i>Alexander
ab Alexandro</i>, and <i>Raphael Volateranus</i>, who liv’d
the same Time at <i>Rome</i> that this Tomb is reported to
have been found, do not so much as mention one
word of a <i>Lamp</i> found burning, whereas that being
a Thing so very wonderful and miraculous, it could
not easily be conceal’d, seeing that even common and
frivolous Things are so easily listn’d to by such as are
desirous of and expect Novelties: Nay <i>Alexander</i> plainly
enough lays down, that there was no Inscription; and
<i>Licetus</i> himself does not affirm, that there was any <i>Lamp</i>
found burning in that Sepulchre, so that as <i>Ferrarius</i>
observes, it appears to be a meer Invention of <i>Pancirollus</i>,
who out of an innate desire of relating wonderful
Things, and pleas’d with the sweetness of Fables, first receiv’d
it for a Truth, and afterwards communicated it
to Posterity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Yet was this not so strange and wonderful a <i>Lamp</i>
as that of <i>Pallas</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of <i>Pallas</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which <i>Martinus</i> the Chronologer relates,
and to which <i>Boccatius</i>, <i>Philippus Bergomas</i> and
<i>Volateranus</i> assent, <i>viz.</i> That in the Year 1501, when
<i>Henry</i> III. was Emperor, a Countryman digging deep
in the Earth, near the City of <i>Rome</i>, discover’d a Tomb
of Stone, wherein lay a Body so tall, that being erected,
it over-top’d the Walls of that City, and was as
entire as if it had been but newly bury’d, having a
very large Wound on the Breast, and a burning <i>Lamp</i>
at its Head, which could neither be extinguish’d by
Wind nor Water, so that they were forc’d to perforate
the bottom of the <i>Lamp</i>, and by that means put
out the Flame. This was said to be the Body of <i>Pallas</i>
slain by <i>Turnus</i>, these Verses being inscrib’d on the
Sepulchre:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Filius Evandri Pallas, quem Lancea Turni</i></span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Militis occidit</i>, more suo <i>jacet hic</i>.</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'>Others read it:——<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mole sua <i>jacet hic</i></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This <i>Lamp</i> is said to have burn’d 2511 Years, and
perhaps would have continu’d so to the end of the
World, had it not been broke and the Liquor spilt.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ridicul’d.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now as this Story appears very fabulous, so <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferrarius
de Lucernis Sepulchralibus</span></cite>, p. 17. as wittily ridicules it,
thinking it a fitter Tale for an old Grannam in a Chimney-Corner
to quiet a peevish and froward Child with,
than for a Man of Sense to give credit to; nay, he
declares, that for his part, he is almost asham’d to reherse
it: Can any one think, says he, that <i>Pallas</i> was
so tall a Giant as to surmount the Walls of <i>Rome</i>, or
that any one should be so foolish to measure the Body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>by the Wall, and not by a Foot-Rule, Cubit or Yard?
That the Orifice of the Wound should be four Foot
wide, and proportionably big to his Body, so that a
little Man might jump in and out at it? Surely in
this Case <i>Turnus</i>’s Lance must have been as big as
that of <i>Polyphemus</i> or the <i>Philistian Goliah</i>’s. Besides,
if <i>Pallas</i> were but a Lad when he was slain, as the
Poet make him, and yet taller than the Turrets of the
<i>Roman</i> Walls, what would he have come to if he had
liv’d? Would he not, think you, have encreas’d in
height ’till he had equall’d the Obelisk of the Sun? Besides,
it must have been more than an <i>Egyptian Embalming</i>
that could have preserv’d a Body of that bulk
entire for about 26 Ages: Yet, grant all this, the Poet
says expresly, the Body of <i>Pallas</i> was burn’d and not
bury’d. No less absurd and barbarous are the Verses
of the Inscription, which, instead of being elegant and
sublime, are mean and poor, undoubtedly compos’d
in some Cottage or Ale-House; for what can be meant
by <i>more suo</i>, unless he lay in a different posture from
what other Bodies are wont to do, or by <i>mole sua</i>, but
his being of an unsizeable bulk? However both are
as ridiculous and foolish as the <i>Latin</i> is trivial. Nevertheless
<i>Licetus</i> endeavours to defend both, alledging by
<i>more suo</i> is meant, that there is no other situation of Bodies
more proper than lying, either when they are asleep,
which is the Emblem of Death, or when they are sick,
which is the way to it, but what need he then mention
that which every Body knows? The other words
<i>mole sua</i>, he says, were to describe the bulk of his Gigantic
Body, or else by reason the Ancients thought
the Soul tarry’d with the Body in the Sepulchre, or
wander’d about it, yet could not either stand, sit or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>lye, as being an incorporeal Substance, it was said of
his Body, as separated from the Soul, and laid up in a
Sepulchre, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mole sua jacet hic</span></i>; so that ’tis the Opinion
of this great Philosopher and Critic, that <i>mole sua</i> was
added to the Verse, lest any one should suspect the
Body and Soul of <i>Pallas</i> did lye together in the same
Cave. As to the <i>Lamp</i>, which exceeds all Faith and
Belief, for it is affirm’d to have burn’d 2611 Years,
and that whereas other <i>Lamps</i> were but small, and
soon extinguish’d by the immission of Air, or the blast
of Winds, this great and contumacious Flame, well befitting
a Giant, defy’d both the light of the Day or
darting of the Sun-Beams, and the rushing in of Air
or blasts of Wind, and, as they tell you, would have
continu’d so for ever, if it had not been broken, whereas
they might have better said, if the Liquor had not
been spilt, seeing it might have been easier extinguish’d,
by inverting the <i>Lamp</i>, and pouring out that precious
Oil, which yielded Aliment to the Eternal Fire; nay
every one knows, who has seen these <i>Lamps</i>, that
they were wont to have several holes at top, wherein
they pour’d the Oil: These are foolish and absurd
Stories both committed to Print and Posterity, as if
they were only to come into the Hands of Boys, or
Cucumber-headed Men, as <i>Ferrarius</i> expresses himself.
There are several other Relations of this kind, as the
Golden <i>Lamp</i> in the Temple of <i>Minerva</i> at <i>Athens</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of <i>Minerva</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which, says <i>Pausanias</i>, burn’d a whole Year, and was
the workmanship of <i>Callimachus</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The <i>Lamp</i> of <i>Jupiter
Ammon</i>, which <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Lib. de Def. Oracul.</i> speaks
of, and which is affirm’d by the Priests to have burn’d
continually, yet consum’d less Oil every Year than
the former, and tho’ it burn’d in the open Air, neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Wind nor Water could extinguish it. A <i>Lamp</i>
in the Fane of <i>Venus</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Of <i>Venus</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which St. <i>Austin</i> speaks of, being
of the same Nature with the fore-going, unextinguishable
either by Wind or Water.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A <i>Lamp</i> found at <i>Edessa</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A <i>Lamp</i> at <i>Edessa</i>,
that <i>Cedrenus</i> mentions, which being hid at the top
of a certain Gate, burn’d 500 Years. Another very
wonderfull <i>Lamp</i> was that of <i>Olybius Maximus</i> of <i>Padua</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> of <i>Olybius</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
found near <i>Atteste</i>, which <i>Scardeonius</i>, Lib. 1.
Class. 3. cap. <i>ult.</i> thus describes: In a large Earthen-Urn
was contain’d a lesser, and in that a burning
<i>Lamp</i>, which had continu’d so 1500 Years, by means
of a most pure Liquor contain’d in two Bottles, one
of Gold and the other of Silver. These are in the
Custody of <i>Franciscus Maturantius</i>, and are by him
valu’d at an exceeding Rate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abundance of other <i>Lamps</i> of the like Nature are
describ’d by <i>Licetus</i>, and confuted by <i>Ferrarius</i>, whither
we refer you; for seeing they are but improbable
Stories, and the Fictions of Poets, we think it not
worth while to spend our Time in repeating them;
but in the next place will proceed to enquire after
what manner Authors do suppose perpetual burning
<i>Lamps</i> to have been made.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lamps</i> that have burn’d by a <i>Divine Power</i>,</div>

<p class='c009'>These, says <i>Licetus</i>, <i>Kircher</i> and others, were order’d
divers ways, <i>First</i>, Miraculously and Preternaturally,
as was that at <i>Antioch</i>, which burn’d 1500 Years in an
open and public Place, over the Door of a Church, preserv’d
by that Divine Power who hath made so infinite
a number of Stars to burn with perpetual Light. <i>Secondly</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>By the wiles of the <i>Devil</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By the wiles of the Devil, who, as St. <i>Austin</i>
tells us, deceives such a thousand ways, who, out of
Curiosity and Avarice, consult Oracles or worship false
Gods, so that when Men sought for the Sepulchres of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>these Gods, nothing was more easie than for the Devil
to represent a flash of Light or Flame to them at their
first entring into such <i>Subterranean Caves</i>. Others
assign Natural Reasons for this, as that which Countrymen
imagine to be a burning <i>Lamp</i>, at their first
finding those <i>Sepulchres</i>, may be only a kind of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ignis
fatuus</span></i>, or pellucid Matter which shines in the dark;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Or from a <i>Natural Cause</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for such glimmering Coruscations are frequently seen
in Church-Yards and fat marshy Grounds, especially at
the breaking up of old Tombs, where no Air has been
immitted for many Ages. Also Miners observe, that
at the first opening of a new Vein of Ore, such flames
or flashes of Light break forth; yet are these not sufficient
Arguments for criticizing Philosophers, for some
believe a <i>Lamp</i> may be made with such Art as to burn
perpetually, and others as absolutely deny it, alledging
that whatever is resolv’d into Vapour or Smoak
cannot be permanent, but will consume, and the oily
Nutriment of a lighted <i>Lamp</i> is exhal’d into a Vapour,
therefore the Fire cannot be perpetual for want of a <i>Pabulum</i>.
On the contrary, those that defend the possibility
of making a perpetual <i>Lamp</i>, deny that all the Nourishment
of kindl’d Fire must of necessity evaporate into
a Damp or Vapour, asserting, that there are things
in Nature, which not only resist the force of Fire, and
are inconsumable by it, but also inextinguishable either
by Wind or Water: Such as these are some peculiar
Preparations of <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i> or <i>Mercury</i>; <i>Naptha</i>,
<i>Petroleum</i>, and the like bituminous <i>Oils</i>; also <i>Oil</i> of
<i>Camphir</i>, <i>Amber</i> and <i>Bricks</i>; the <i>Lapis Asbestos seu Amianthus</i>,
<i>Lapis Carystius</i>, <i>Cyprius</i> and <i>Magnesius</i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Linum
vivum seu Creticum</span></i>, &amp;c. of all which in their Order.
<i>First</i>, They affirm such Matter might be prepar’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>either of <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>, or the like Metal,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Or can be made with <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
made
fluid after a particular manner, and <i>Gold</i> they thought
the fittest <i>Pabulum</i> for such an inconsumable <i>Lamp</i>,
because, of all Metals, that wastes the least when either
heated or melted, yet what Oily Humidity can that
or any other Metal afford which will catch Fire and
continue its Flame? But that these perpetual <i>Lamps</i>,
if ever there were any such, were not prepar’d of
Metals, is sufficiently confuted by <cite>Licetus</cite>, p. 130 and
132. and by <cite>Ferrarius</cite>, p. 16. tho’ <i>Licetus</i> in another
place, <cite>viz.</cite> p. 44. makes mention of a Preparation of
Quicksilver purged seven Times, thro’ white Sand by
Fire, of which, he says, <i>Lamps</i> were made that would
burn perpetually; and that this Liquor was variously
nam’d by the Chymists,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Or <i>Mercury</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Mercurialis</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Materia
Metallorum</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">perpetua Dispositio</span></i>, <i>Materia prima Artis</i>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitrum perenne incorruptumque</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oleum Vitri</span></i>, and the
like. Nevertheless, how fabulous soever this may seem,
both <i>Maturantius</i> and <i>Citesius</i> aver they firmly believe,
that to make a <i>Lamp</i> which will burn perpetually,
must of necessity be a Chymical Work, tho’ perhaps
not made from any Preparation of Metal.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two <i>Chymical Experiments</i> for making <i>Eternal Fire</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This appears
from the Chymical Experiments of <i>Tritenhemius</i>
and <i>Bartholomeus Korndorferus</i>, who both made Preparations
for Eternal Fire after the following manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First <i>Experiment</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>The first was thus made: ℞ <i>Sulphur. Alum. ust. a</i> ℥ iv.
sublime them into Flowers to ℥ ij. of which add of
Christalline <i>Venetian</i> Borax pouder’d ℥ j. upon these
affuse high rectify’d Spirit of Wine and digest it, then
abstract it and pour on fresh: Repeat this so often
’till the Sulphur melt like Wax, without any Smoak,
upon a hot Plate of Brass, and this is for the <i>Pabulum</i>,
but the Wiek is to be prepar’d after this manner: You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>must gather together the Threds or Thrums of the
<i>Lapis Asbestos</i>, to the thickness of your middle, and
length of your little Finger, which done, put them
into a <i>Venice</i> Glass, and covering them over with the
aforesaid depurated Sulphur or Aliment, set the Glass
in Sand for the space of 24 Hours, so hot that the
Sulphur may bubble all the while. The Wiek being
thus besmear’d and anointed, is to be put into a Glass
like a Scallop-Shell, in such manner, that some part
of it may lye above the Mass of prepar’d Sulphur;
then setting this Glass upon hot Sand, you must melt
the Sulphur, so that it may lay hold of the Wiek, and
when ’tis lighted it will burn with a perpetual Flame,
and you may set this <i>Lamp</i> in any Place where you
please. The way of making the other Eternal Fire
is thus:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Second <i>Experiment</i>.</div>

<p class='c009'>℞. <i>Salis tosti</i>, lb. j. affuse over it strong Wine-Vinegar,
and abstract it to the consistency of Oil; then
put on fresh Vinegar and macerate and distill it as
before. This repeat four Times successively, then put
into this Vinegar <i>Vitr. Antimonii subtiliss. lævigat</i>, lb. j.
set it on Ashes in a close Vessel for the space of six
Hours, to extract its Tincture, decant the Liquor,
and put on fresh, and then extract it again; this repeat
so often ’till you have got out all the redness.
Coagulate your Extractions to the consistency of Oil,
and then rectifie them in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>: Then take
the <i>Antimony</i>, from which the Tincture was extracted,
and reduce it to a very fine Meal, and so put it into a
glass Bolthead; pour upon it the rectify’d Oil, which
abstract and cohobate seven Times, ’till such time as
the Pouder has imbib’d all the Oil, and is quite dry.
This extract again with Spirit of Wine, so often, ’till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>all the Essence be got out of it, which put into a
<i>Venice</i> Matrass, well luted with Paper five-fold, and
then distill it so that the Spirit being drawn off, there
may remain at bottom an inconsumable Oil, to be
us’d with a Wiek after the same manner with the
Sulphur we have describ’d before.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are those Eternal Lights of <i>Tritenhemius</i>, adds
<i>Libavius</i>’s Commentator, which indeed tho’ they do
not agree with the Pertinacy of <i>Naptha</i>, yet these things
can illustrate one another.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lamp</i> made with <i>Naptha</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Naptha</i> is not so durable
as not to be burn’d, for it exhales and deflagrates, but
if it be fix’d by adding the Juice of the <i>Lapis Asbestinos</i>,
it can afford Perpetual Fuell, so says that Learned Person
upon this Matter. Moreover, <i>Naptha</i> is a sort of
<i>Bitumen</i> so very hot, that it presently burns every
Thing it adheres to, nor is it easily extinguish’d by
any moist Thing; and <i>Pliny</i> says it has such Affinity
with Fire, that it presently leaps to it wherever it finds
it. Thus ’tis reported <i>Glauca</i> was burnt by <i>Medea</i>,
when she came to Sacrifice, for approaching the Altar
the Fire immediately caught hold of her: This
was because <i>Jason</i>, being in Love with <i>Glauca</i>, the
Daughter of <i>Creon</i> King of <i>Corinth</i>, had forsaken <i>Medea</i>,
when she to be reveng’d on that Princess, wetted
her Vail and Crown with <i>Naptha</i>, by which means she
might be the sooner set on Fire, as <i>Plutarch</i> has it in
the Life of <i>Alexander</i> the Great. Thus as <i>Naptha</i> is
very inflamable and ready to catch Fire, so is it not
easily extinguish’d either by Wind or Water, but
burns more violently if cast into the Water, or agitated
by the Wind. Of this kind also are some other
sorts of <i>Bitumen</i>, such as <i>Petroleum</i>, <i>Amber</i>, <i>Camphir</i>,
&amp;c. therefore may be proper Ingredients for these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>sorts of <i>Lamps</i> we are speaking of. Now in <i>Egypt</i>
there were many Places full of <i>Bitumen</i> and <i>Petroleum</i>,
as <i>Bellonius</i>, <i>Radzivillus</i>, <i>Vallæus</i>, <i>Burattinus</i>, and other
Searchers into <i>Egyptian</i> Antiquities testifie, which were
constituted by the hidden Counsels of Nature, with
an inexhaustible store of Matter; wherefore the Learned
among them, who were great Naturalists, having
discover’d these bituminous Wells or Fountains,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>With liquid <i>Bitumen</i> or <i>Petroleum</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
laid
from them secret Canals or Pipes to the Subterranean
Caves and Sepulchres of the Dead, where, in a convenient
Place, they set a <i>Lamp</i> with a Wiek of <i>Asbestos</i>,
which was constantly moisten’d and supply’d with Oil
by means of this Duct from the afore-said Places:
Seeing therefore the flowing of the Oil was perpetual,
and the Wiek of <i>Asbestos</i> inconsumable, it must of necessity
follow, that the Light also endur’d perpetually.
And that this was so,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Confirm’d by <i>Schiangia</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
fully appears from what <i>Schiangia</i>
an <i>Arabian</i> Author relates in his History of the
memorable Things of <i>Egypt</i>, in much the same Words
as follow: ‘There was a Field in <i>Egypt</i> whose Ditches
were full of Pitch and liquid <i>Bitumen</i>, whence the
Philosophers knowing the force of Nature, dug some
Canals to their Subterranean <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cryptæ</span></i>, where they set
a <i>Lamp</i>, which was joyn’d to the afore-said Canals,
and which having a Wiek of incombustible Flax, by
that means being once lighted, it burn’d perpetually
by reason of the continual afflux of <i>Bitumen</i>, and the
incombustible Wiek.’ The same thing might perhaps
be effected with <i>Naptha</i>, which flow’d at <i>Mutina</i>
in <i>Italy</i>, as also with <i>Petroleum</i> and <i>Sicilian Oil</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>And believ’d by <i>Kircher</i>, &amp;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This <i>Kircher</i> and several others are of Opinion is the
true way of making <i>perpetual Lamps</i>, seeing it is a
Thing purely natural, where such Bituminous Oils do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>abound, and has no other difficulty in it, but preparing
the Wiek of <i>Asbestos</i>, or the like, which comes
next under our Consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lapis Asbestos.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>First <i>Asbestos</i>, call’d by the <i>Greeks</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄσβεστος</span><a id='t357'></a>, i.&thinsp;e. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inextinguibilis</span></i>,
a kind of Stone, which being set on fire,
cannot be quench’d, as <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Solinus</i> write. <i>Albertus
Magnus</i> describes it to be a Stone of an Iron colour,
found for the most part in <i>Arabia</i>, and of such strange
Virtue, as was manifest in the Temples of the Heathen
Gods, that being once lighted it was never to be extinguish’d,
by reason of some small quantity of oleaginous
Moisture, which was inseparately mix’d with
it, and which being inflam’d cherish’d the Fire: Now
could any expert <i>Chymist</i> rightly extract this indissoluble
Oil, we need not question but it would afford
a perpetual <i>Pabulum</i> for these <i>Eternal Lamps</i> which the
Ancients boast of; but many Experiments of that kind
have been made in vain, some affirming,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its <i>Oil</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Liquor
chymically extracted from that Stone was more of a
watry than oily Nature, and withal so fæculent, that
it was not capable to receive Fire and exist. Others
again have said, that this Oil was of so thick and solid
a Substance that it would hardly flow, and for the
most part burn’d not at all or but very indifferently,
emitting no Flame, or if it did, it shone not with a
bright splendor, but cast up thick and dark Fumes,
whereas on the contrary, those <i>Lamps</i> of the Ancients,
which burn’d so many Ages, yielded a clear and bright
Flame without any Smoak to soil the Vessel and circum-ambient
Places, and which in time might both obscure,
stop up and put out the Light: Hence <i>Kircher</i> is
of Opinion, that tho’ the Mistery of extracting this Oil
be not impracticable, yet it is very difficult to be attain’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>to by any Humane Art, and as <i>Ferrarius</i> also
observes, that as the Stone <i>Asbestos</i>, if once lighted is
inextinguishable, so much more must its Oil be both
incombustible and inextinguishable, wherefore it does
not appear that the <i>Lamps</i> of the Ancients were made
either of one or the other, seeing for the most part
they are said to have gone out immediately on the
opening of the Sepulchre where they were plac’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Asbeston seu Asbestinum.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Secondly</i>, The very same is said of <i>Asbeston sive Asbestinum</i>,
which the <i>Greeks</i> call <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄσβεστον</span>,<a id='t358b'></a> i.&thinsp;e. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inextinguibile,
&amp; est genus Lini quod<a id='t358'></a> Ignibus non absumitur</span></i>, a
kind of Flax of which they made Cloth that was to
be cleans’d by burning, as Tobacco-Pipes are. <i>Pliny</i>
calls it <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Linum vivum</span></i> and <i>Indian</i> Flax, and says it was
so dear it was esteem’d equal to Pearl and Precious
Stones, for it was hard to be met with, and then very
difficult to be woven, by reason of the shortness of it.
Also he tells us the Bodies of Kings were wont to be
wrapp’d in this sort of Cloth, when they were to
be burn’d, to the end the Ashes might be preserv’d
unmix’d from those of the <i>Funeral Pile</i>, in order to
the laying them up in Urns, as the Custom then was
when they burn’d their dead Bodies. Moreover <i>Pliny</i>
says, he saw some Napkins of this sort of Cloth in his
Time, and was an Eye-Witness of the Experiment of
purifying them by Fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>One <i>Podocattarus</i>, a <i>Cyprian</i> Knight, who wrote <i>de
Rebus Cypriis</i> in the Year 1566, had both Flax and
Linnen of this kind with him at <i>Venice</i>, which <i>Porcacchius</i>
says, in his Book of <i>Antient Funerals</i>, he and many
others that were with him, saw at that Knight’s
House. Also <i>Ludovicus Vives</i> saw a Towel of this
kind at <i>Lovain</i> in <i>Brabant</i>, and several Wieks of it at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span><i>Paris</i>, as he himself relates in his Commentary upon
St. <i>Austin</i>’s Treatise <i>de Civitate Dei</i>. Likewise <i>Baptista
Porta</i>, says he saw the same thing at <i>Venice</i> in the
hands of a <i>Cyprian</i> Woman, and which he terms <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secretum
optimum, perpulchrum &amp; perutile</span></i>, a very useful,
beautiful and profitable Secret. Several other Authors
testifie they have seen the same, but <i>Henricus Salmuthius</i>,
in his Commentary upon <cite>Pancirollus</cite>, p.
16. will have this sort of Linnen to be call’d <i>Asbestinum</i>,
from its likeness to Chalk, which he says the
<i>Greeks</i> term’d <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄσβεστον</span>, for as that is wont to be purify’d
by Fire, so is this Linnen made clean and white by burning.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two <i>Objections</i> against this <i>Asbeston</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now the chief Objections <i>Ferrarius</i> makes against
<i>Pliny</i>’s Account of this incombustible and inextinguishable
Flax are, first, That if Wieks had been made
of it, they would never have been consum’d or extinguish’d,
or when once the Funeral Pile was lighted, the
incombustible Linnen, wherein the Bodies were wrapp’d,
as also the Napkins and Towels, which Authors mention,
would never have been quench’d, but have burn’d
perpetually, whereas, he says, this kind of Linnen burn’d
only so long as either Grease, Fat, or the like <i>Sordes</i>
afforded the Flame a <i>Pabulum</i>, wherefore that being
consum’d which had occasion’d the Spots or Dirt, the
Linnen appear’d more white and clean than if it had
been wash’d with Water and Soap. From this it appears
also that those Funeral Shrouds of Kings, often
mention’d in Authors, burn’d only so long upon the
Pile as the Fat or <i>Sanies</i> of the Body afforded Aliment,
and when that fail’d, the Flame ceas’d likewise; for
otherwise, if this sort of Flaxen Linnen had been inextinguishable,
as <i>Salmuthius</i> seems to imply by the word
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄσβεστον</span>, how could those Napkins or Funeral Shrouds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>when once burn’d, be ever handl’d or made use of any
more without burning whatever they came near or
touch’d? The second Objection is taken from <i>Pliny</i>’s
own Words, who tells us, this sort of Flax was very
scarce and of great Price, being preserv’d for the
Kings of that Country only, so that ’tis highly probable
the <i>Egyptians</i> might make use of another sort of
Cloth,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lapis Amiantus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
made of the Stone <i>Amiantus</i>, for burning their
Bodies, and which, <i>Pliny</i> says, they had the Art of
Spinning at that Time. <i>Plutarch</i> also assures us that in
his Time there was a Quarry of that Stone in the
Island of <i>Negropont</i>, and that the like was to be found
in the Isle of <i>Cyprus</i>, <i>Tines</i>, and else-where. Moreover,
’tis the common Opinion of the Learned, that both
Funeral Shrouds or Sheets, Table-Cloths, Napkins and
the Wieks of the Perpetual <i>Lamps</i> of the Ancients,
were made of this <i>Lapis Amiantus</i>, which Linnen, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<i>Porcacchius</i> and <i>Ludovicus Vives</i> have particularly spoken
of before: Besides, as <i>Dasamus</i> relates, the Emperor
<i>Constantine</i> caus’d Wieks to be made of this Flax for those
<i>Lamps</i> which burn’d perpetually in his Bathing Place,
and <i>Agricola</i> affirms, that both Napkins, Table-Cloths,
<i>&amp;c.</i> were made at <i>Rome</i>, and at <i>Vereberge</i> in <i>Bohemia</i>,
of this <i>Lapis Amiantus</i>, which instead of washing
when dirty, they were wont to cleanse and purifie by
Fire. The best sort of this Stone was to be had in
<i>Cyprus</i> and <i>India</i>, from the former of which Countries
it came to be call’d <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lapis Cyprius</span></i> and <i>Linum Cyprium</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lapis Cyprius</span></i> and <i>Linum Cyprium</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but of late there has been very good found in some Mines
of <i>Italy</i>, of which see <i>Philosophical Transact.</i> No. 72.
This Stone being beaten with a Hammer, and the
Earth and Dust shaken out, appears like to Flax with
its Filaments, and then is spun and woven into Cloth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>which Art, says Dr. <i>Grew</i> in his Description of the
Rarities in <i>Gresham</i>-College, as well as the Use is
thought to be utterly lost, tho’ it be not really so;
for <i>Septalius</i> in his <i>Musæum</i> has or lately had, both
Thread, Ropes, Paper and Net-work, all made of this
Flax, and some of them with his own Hand. But
<i>Grew</i> seems to make <i>Asbestinus Lapis</i> and <i>Amiantus</i> all
one, and calls them in <i>English</i> the <i>Thrum-Stone</i>; he
says it grows in short Threads or Thrums, from about
a quarter of an Inch to an Inch in length, parallel and
glossy, as fine as those small single Threads the Silk-Worm
spins, and very flexile like to Flax or Tow.
There are several pieces of this kind in the aforesaid
<i>Musæum</i>, both white and green, of which the latter
has the longest Threads and the most flexile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Others think the Funeral Shrouds, wherein the dead
Bodies of Kings were burn’d, as also the Wieks of
those Perpetual <i>Lamps</i> were made of the <i>Lapis Carystius</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lapis Carystius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a Stone so call’d from the City <i>Carystos</i>, and
which signifies, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ardens Tela, quod ex Lapide Carystio
texeretur; Tela cujus sordes Igne purgabantur</span></i>. The Inhabitants
kemb’d, spun and wove this downy Stone into
Mantles, Table-Linnen and the like, which when
foul they purify’d again with Fire instead of Water, as
<i>Mattheus Raderus</i> mentions in his Comment on the
77th Epigr. of the IX. Book of <i>Martial</i>. Also <i>Pausanias</i>
in <i>Atticis</i>, and <cite>Plutarch</cite> Lib. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Oraculorum defectu</span></cite>,
deliver that the Wieks of <i>Lamps</i> made hereof, and
burn’d with Oil, never consum’d, tho’ the latter says the
Stone was not to be found in his Time.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Linum Carpasium.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Others say it
was the <i>Linum Carpasium</i> which was apply’d to all these
Uses, so call’d <i>a Carpaso, Cypri Urbe</i>, and that Linnen
made thereof was call’d <i>Carbasa</i>, which <i>Solinus</i> says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>would endure Fire without consuming. Sometimes
also ’tis call’d <i>Linum Cyprium</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cyprium.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of which kind of Flax
it was made, and they report the before-mention’d <i>Podocatterus</i>,
a <i>Cyprian</i> Knight, shew’d a piece of it to
the <i>Venetians</i>, and which he cleans’d by burning in the
Fire. <i>Franciscus Ruæus</i>, <i>Albertus Magnus</i>, <i>Cælius Rhodiginus</i>,
<i>Camillus</i>, <i>Leonardus</i>, <i>Isiodorus</i>, and many other
famous Writers alledge, if a Wiek be made of this
kind of Flax, it will not consume with Fire, and <i>Pausanias</i>
particularly says, the Wiek of the Golden <i>Lamp</i>
of <i>Minerva</i> was made hereof. Much like this, if not
directly the same, was the Flax call’d <i>Linum Creticum</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Creticum.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for, as <i>Solinus</i> asserts, those <i>Carbasa</i>, that would endure
the Fire, were made in <i>Crete</i>. Also <i>Strabo</i> says this
<i>Linum Creticum</i> was made out of a Rock, beaten into
Threads, and the Earthy Matter shaken out, after which
’twas kemb’d and woven into Cloth which was not to
be consum’d, but might be cleans’d by burning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other Authors say inconsumable Cloth, and the
Wieks of Perpetual <i>Lamps</i> were made of the Stones
<i>Magnesia</i>, <i>Alumen Sciscile</i>, and the like;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Magnesia</i>, <i>Alumen Sciscile</i>, &amp;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but whether
under different Denominations one thing might be
meant, I can by no means pretend to determin, altho’
<i>Hieronymus Mercurialis</i> thinks Linnen made of the
<i>Lapis Carystius</i> to be the same which <i>Pliny</i> calls <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Linum
vivum</span></i>, <i>Pausanias</i>, <i>Carpasium</i>, <i>Solinus</i>, <i>Carbasum</i>, <i>Zoroaster</i>,
<i>Bostrichitem</i>, others <i>Corsoidem</i>, some <i>Poliam</i> or <i>Spartopoliam</i>,
and the common People <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Villam Salamandræ</span></i>.
Tho’ after all, the Ancients might very probably have
some other Invention for burning Bodies, such as to
set them on the Fire in a Coffin of Stone, Brass or Iron,
from whence it was very easie to gather the Ashes and
Bones that were not consum’d; and as for the <i>Lamps</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>some are of Opinion they had no Wieks at all:
Among these was <i>Licetus</i>, who believes the antient
<i>Lamps</i> wanted Wieks, because few or none of them
have been found, and <i>Ludovicus Vives</i> is the only
Person that affirms he has seen any; but this is nevertheless
a conjectural Opinion, since they might have
been destroy’d either by Time, Fire or any other Accident.
However, he at least affirms the Wiek of a
<i>Lamp</i> not to be absolutely necessary towards its burning,
by reason <i>Camphir</i>, <i>Naptha</i>, <i>Oil of Bricks</i>, liquid
<i>Bitumen</i>, and the like, will for the most part take Fire
without any addition of a Wiek. <i>Ferrarius</i>, on the
contrary, does not deny but rather confirm the use of
Wieks, making the Question dubious,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Whether the <i>Perpetuity</i> of a <i>Lamp</i> proceeded from the <i>Oil</i> or <i>Wiek</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whether the perpetuity
of Light in <i>Lamps</i> proceeded mostly from the
Oil or Wiek? If from the Oil, says he, why did they
generally go out upon the admission of Air into the
Sepulchre at its first opening? For Air or a gentle gale
of Wind is not commonly found prejudicial to the
flame of Oil, but only violent Blasts or Storms, which
if absent, the Flame or Light will continue so long
as the Aliment lasts. But how then came the <i>Lamps</i> of
<i>Minerva</i>, <i>Pallas</i> and others not to be extinguish’d by the
rushing in of Wind or sprinkling of Dust, and only
by breaking the <i>Lamp</i>? Surely there must needs have
been two kinds of inconsumable Oil, one which fear’d
any admission of Air, and another which defy’d the
most violent storms of Rain or Wind; or perhaps
one might be the effect of an Oil-<i>Lamp</i> without
any Wiek, and the other of a <i>Lamp</i> which had both
Oil and Wiek, which certainly must have been the
most permanent. For grant there are some Oils so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>spirituous and inflammable, that they will of themselves
catch Fire at a great distance, yet must these
needs be too volatile to occasion a <i>Lamp</i> to burn
perpetually, unless they are fix’d with some more permanent
Matter,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Both <i>Wiek</i> and <i>Oil</i> in a <i>Lamp</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and then they cannot be so easily
lighted without a Wiek; neither can we understand
how it should burn so above the <i>Lamp</i>, unless the
Flame be supported by a little Cord or Wiek, the
Vehicle of the Oil: Besides, What can that little <i>Foramen</i>
at the Beak of all the <i>Lamps</i> mean, but only to
thrust the Wiek and Light out at? ’Tis plain therefore
they had Wieks, but what they were made of,
whether of <i>Asbestos</i>, <i>Amiantus</i>, or any of the before-mention’d
Things, is somewhat difficult to decide;
forasmuch as they being reported both to have been
inconsumable and inextinguishable, when once lighted,
they must needs have burn’d perpetually, and consequently
the <i>Lamps</i> have had no occasion for any Oil;
but this is certainly false, for both the <i>Lamps</i> and <i>Funeral
Shrouds</i> burn’d only so long as there was any
Oil, Fat, or oleaginous Moisture remaining, which
being consum’d they likewise ceas’d, yet might perhaps
remain unconsum’d, but that without any
Flame. However, we must not deny there were any
Wieks in <i>Lamps</i>, because they could not, as most are
of opinion, continue to burn of themselves without
any oily inflammable Matter, but rather all believe
both the Oil and Wiek had a Virtue to assist each
other, and on the contrary could not burn separately
for any duration or considerable Time. But some
have thought quite otherwise of this matter, <i>viz.</i> That
what Country-Peasants imagine they see at the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>breaking up of such Sepulchres are only the sudden
irradiations and reflections of the Sun in those dark
Caves, or else some sparks of Light rais’d by the percussion
or attrition of their Iron-Tools against the
Stones, a glimmering Vapour of the Earth, or the like
Appearances, which being heightn’d by the strength
of their prepossess’d Fancy, they easily take to be one
of the Perpetual <i>Lamps</i> of the Ancients, which had
burn’d ’till then, but was immediately extinguish’d
upon the rushing in of the Air, or accidental breaking
of the <i>Lamp</i>. But <i>Gutherius</i> thinks the contrary; he
imagines it was some Liquor or Pouder which took
fire at the entring in of the Air: And <i>Johan. Sigism.
Elholtius</i>, in his Observations <cite>de Phosphoris</cite>, p. 9. obs. 2.
Sect. 4. compares his liquid <i>Phosphorus</i> or <i>Cold Fire</i>,
as he terms it, with the <i>Lamps</i> of the Ancients in these
Words:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Perpetual Burning Lamp</i> thought to be liquid <i>Phosphorus</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Plura circa</i> frigidum <i>hunc</i> Ignem <i>Phœnomina
hactenus non observavimus, in posterum tamen istis experimentis
plus operæ sumus impensuri, &amp; postea communicaturi.
Profecto, si conjectura quorundam de</i> Lucernis
Veterum <i>Sepulchralibus vera est, quod scilicet non Mille
vel amplius Annos illa arserint, sed quod apertæ demum
ardere cæperint, tum utique ab Oleo illo Antiquorum, non
multum obfuerit hic</i> Phosphorus liquidus. <i>Qui enim

motus, corruscare atque flagrare incipit: restauratæq;
hoc pacto forent Lucernæ illæ, multis retro Seculis

observ’d more</i> Phœnomena <i>concerning this</i> Cold
Fire, <i>nevertheless intend for the future to spend more
Time and Labour in these Experiments, and then will
communicate them to the Public. But surely if a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Conjecture concerning the</i> Lamps <i>of the Ancients
be true</i>, viz. <i>That they burn’d not a Thousand or more
Years, but at length when they came to be discover’d
began to burn, then certainly this liquid</i> Phosphorus
<i>cannot differ much from that Oil of the Ancients, which
lying quiet and stopp’d up, hardly shines; but being
open’d, in the motion of opening begins to corruscate
and burn, and after this manner those</i> Lamps <i>would
be restor’d, which are related by all to have been lost
for many Ages</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Licetus</i>’s Opinion that a <i>Perpetual Lamp</i> may be made.</div>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, <i>Licetus</i> endeavours to persuade us
that a <i>Pabulum</i> for Fire may be given with such an
equal Temperament, as cannot be consum’d but after
a long Series of Ages, and so that neither the Matter
shall exhale but strongly resist the Fire, nor the Fire
consume the Matter, but be restrain’d by it, as it were
with a Chain, from flying upward. This, says Sir <i>Thomas
Brown</i> in his <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, p. 124. speaking of <i>Lamps</i>
which have burn’d many Hundreds of Years, included
in close Bodies, proceeds from the Purity of the Oil,
which yeilds no fuliginous Exhalations to suffocate
the Fire; for if Air had nourish’d the Flame, then it
had not continu’d many Minutes, for it would certainly
in that case have been spent and wasted by the
Fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Art of preparing this <i>inconsumable Oil</i> is
lost, having perish’d long since, as <i>Pancirollus</i> assures
us, but neither he nor any other Learned Man has
given us any convincing Proof that there ever was
such a Thing, but only think to amuse us with a
wonderful Art, and then tell us only it is quite lost.
And for my part I cannot see hitherto that all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>has been wrote or said on this Subject is sufficient to
prove there ever was any such Thing, and much more
that it ever could be made. <i>Licetus</i>, who has argu’d
most on this Head, is confuted by <i>Aresius</i>, and in a
word, all that can be alledg’d is, that if this Art be
not impossible to be effected, it is nevertheless as difficult
to be attain’d to, by any Human Invention, as the
<i>Perpetual Motion</i> or <i>Philosophers Stone</i>, therefore I shall
not trouble my Thoughts any farther about these
<i>Lamps</i>, but only look on them as so many <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
or Symbols of the <i>Immortality</i> of the <i>Soul</i>, and
heartily pray that we may not want <i>Oil</i> in our <i>Lamps</i>
when the <i>Bridegroom</i> shall come, but be prepar’d to
enjoy <i>Eternal Light</i> with him, which is the devout
Prayer of,</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
